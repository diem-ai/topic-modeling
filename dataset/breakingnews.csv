0,"Joseph Stiglitz does what he does very well. The veteran progressive economist’s latest book provides a solid agenda for traditional centre-left American reformers. However, “People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent” may not be radical enough for today’s challenges."
1,"For all the successes of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies, consumer prices are rising more slowly than the central bank’s 2 percent target. Aiming for a lower inflation rate is acceptable in a country where unemployment is low, especially since asset purchases will remain a lever at monetary policymakers’ disposal."
2,"Japan’s imperial retirement bash will test the country’s reluctant spenders. The world's third-largest economy takes a 10-day break, starting on Saturday, as Crown Prince Naruhito ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne, replacing Emperor Akihito. Travel agents and malls hope for a spending spike, but Japanese workaholics may not turn swiftly into shopaholics. It’s poor news if they don’t, not least for planned efforts to meet rising social security costs.     "
3,"Jeff Bezos’s first letter to Amazon.com shareholders in 1998 said that “it’s all about the long game.” With revenue of $60 billion over the last three months alone – roughly 100 times what it was in the year Bezos penned that missive – the challenges have changed. To ensure the e-commerce giant’s future, Bezos’s best weapons aren’t sales growth, but sprawl and usefulness."
4,"Young, tech-savvy adults say everything from high prices to climate change may prompt them to leave the San Francisco area. Other U.S. cities can benefit. Also: Why CEO Jack Dorsey should favor Square over Twitter. And what to expect from Indonesian President Widodo’s second term."
5,Equity investors concerned only about the short term can rejoice. Corporate profitability remains on an upward trend in developed economies. Everyone else should be worried by the cause: winner-takes-most dynamics.
6,J Sainsbury’s proposed 7.3 billion pound takeover of Walmart-owned Asda has been shelved but UK supermarket mergers may well resurface in the future - in the bargain bin.
7,"China’s Belt and Road Initiative can pave over only some of its potholes. A gathering in Beijing this week to promote the $1 trillion-plus foreign policy push comes after a bumpy year for the flagship scheme, from Pakistan to Malaysia. Under pressure, China has shown some welcome flexibility. But U.S. hostility is ramping up too, and that will be far harder to repair."
8,"Instagram is becoming Facebook’s sugar daddy. The $521 billion social network’s image-sharing unit is a big reason for the company’s strong first-quarter top-line growth. There’s room to wedge more revenue-earning ads into users’ feeds. The risk, though, is the distractions and dodgy content that hamper the “old” Facebook spread to Instagram."
9,"It’s rarely big news when a French bank recruits a new domestic retail chief or a head of strategy. Yet when BNP Paribas and Société Générale filled these positions a year ago, it was all over the French, and even international, press."

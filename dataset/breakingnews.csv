Uber’s dull thud may startle unicorn herd,"Uber Technologies’ lackluster stock-market debut is a warning for other tech unicorns. The ride-sharing service’s shares opened below the initial public offering price – valuing the company at around $70 billion, based on outstanding shares, soon after they started trading on Friday. The lack of positive excitement for the biggest listing of a U.S. technology company since Facebook in 2012 suggests investors are becoming more choosy."
Trade flows will reveal the true cost of tariffs,"Trade flows, not traditional economic measures, will reveal the true cost of tariffs. Washington on Friday hiked duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods. Both sides have intimated they can survive a blow that may only slightly dent their GDP. Shifting supply chains, though, will show the extent of longer-term losses."
Aussie election campaign blows hot air on climate,"Australia's climate-focused election is blowing a lot of hot air. It’s a rare country where green issues sit atop the list of priorities. The $1.3 trillion economy is among the most vulnerable to global warming, but also depends on coal. Unfortunately, neither of the main political parties is tackling the contradiction head-on."
Viewsroom: Oil M&A fight may end with no winner,Occidental boss Vicki Hollub corralled BofA CEO Brian Moynihan and investor Warren Buffett to her side to seal a $38 bln offer for Anadarko. Her tactics scared off rival bidder Chevron but may alienate her own shareholders. Plus: Malaysia’s reform efforts since the 1MDB scandal.
Cox: Trump Fed misfire rallies its true believers,"In June 1971 Arthur Burns, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, sent U.S. President Richard Nixon a nine-page letter in which he summed up the country’s economic challenges: “namely, an inflation feeding on itself at a time of substantial unemployment.” Burns told the Republican president, who had nominated him to the Fed and for whom he previous served as an adviser, that “our monetary and fiscal policies have not been working as expected.”"
BlackRock’s Italian U-turn leaves state on hook,BlackRock’s U-turn on a daring Italian bank rescue puts Rome back on the hook. The world’s biggest asset manager on Thursday confirmed it had dropped plans to join a 720 million euro rescue for ailing bank Carige. The abrupt decision after months of discussions is a belated admission the project was too risky. That is bad news for Italy’s taxpayers.
Uber has recipes to avoid delivery indigestion,Uber Technologies has recipes to avoid food delivery indigestion. The U.S. ride-hailing giant hopes a $795 billion global takeout market can offset slowing growth in its core business. Established rivals like Europe’s Takeaway.com suggest there are ingredients to aid success.
Uber’s losses are nothing like young Amazon’s,"Uber Technologies is no Amazon.com. Some of the ride-hailing firm’s boosters have pushed a comparison with the e-commerce giant in roadshow meetings for the company’s imminent initial public offering, according to news reports. The idea is that hefty losses now are laying the foundation for a future profit juggernaut. Instead of the income statement, though, investors should look at cash flow numbers."
Hadas: CEOs would benefit from more humanities,"“The Defects of an University Education, and its Unsuitableness to a Commercial People” is a little-known work by the Scottish minister William Thom published in 1762, before his compatriot Adam Smith founded modern economics with his “The Wealth of Nations”. Today’s commercial peoples, though, could do with more of something like what his country’s universities were doling out in Thom’s time."
Lyft takes some gas out of Uber’s IPO,"Lyft is likely to take some gas out of Uber Technologies' initial public offering. The smaller ride-hailing app beat revenue estimates in the first quarterly results since its listing, and burned less cash. But its rate of growth is slowing, making profit an ever-more distant goal."
"China defiant toward U.S. on trade, Kudlow urges strong enforcement steps","The United States and China appeared at a deadlock over trade negotiations on Sunday as Washington demanded promises of  concrete changes to Chinese law and Beijing said it would not swallow any ""bitter fruit"" that harmed its interests."
Trump says the U.S. is 'right where we want to be with China',"Lyft is likely to take some gas out of Uber Technologies' initial public offering. The smaller ride-hailing app beat revenue estimates in the first quarterly results since its listing, and burned less cash. But its rate of growth is slowing, making profit an ever-more distant goal."
China says it will never surrender to foreign pressure amid trade dispute,"The EU’s antitrust commissioner is famous for imposing multi-billion-dollar fines on Alphabet and Apple. She joins Liam Proud and Peter Thal Larsen to explain why combatting the greed, power and fear that stifles competition is even more crucial in a data-driven world."
Lyft takes some gas out of Uber’s IPO,"Britons should enjoy cheap stag weekends in Latvia while they can. The UK government has been encouraged by its own advisory body to cut net greenhouse-gas emissions to zero by 2050 – among the most ambitious national targets to date. Given a pre-existing goal for an 80 percent cut by the same date is looking shaky, the implication is either that the targets are hot air, or the government is about to get tough in areas like aviation."
The Exchange: Margrethe Vestager,"Luckin Coffee is serving up a rich brew. It said on Monday it plans to raise as much as $590 million in an initial public offering as it races to overtake Starbucks. Although their business models are different, on at least one comparative measure, the Chinese chain’s implied $4 billion valuation is high."
Aviation is acid test for UK climate credibility,"U.S. hedge-fund boss Ray Dalio is one capitalist who frets about the gap between rich and poor. Yet our planet’s billions of people on average are improving their lot. A report released on Monday shows how land, water and biodiversity, on the other hand, are paying the price."
China’s Luckin Coffee roasts a rich IPO,"Donald Trump’s tariff threats are shaking the foundations of a future trade deal. The U.S. president says he will soon hike duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods. It may well be an eleventh-hour negotiating ploy. It has rattled investors anyway, just as both economies have steadied. Such bursts of frustration with Beijing are worrying: they raise questions about whether a final pact can stick."
Nature is capitalism’s biggest loser,"American workers are paying the price for keeping the economic recovery going. U.S. job creation accelerated in April, trimming the unemployment rate to a 50-year low of 3.6 percent. Yet wage growth remains modest and other data suggest slack in the labor market."
Trump tariff threats shake trade deal foundations,"HSBC’s first-quarter results shore up its rich valuation. The global bank reported a robust 10.6 percent return on tangible equity in the first three months of the year, buoyed by a lending spike. Investors were already assuming that the bank hits its 2020 return targets. Potential for more buybacks in the second half provide additional firepower."
More American workers take one for the team,Tesla’s $2 billion capital raise is repeating the sins of the past. The electric-car maker on Thursday unveiled plans to sell shares and convertible bonds for the first time in two years. That might be enough if Chief Executive Elon Musk can get vehicle sales to rebound quickly. But that’s the kind of hubris that put Tesla in its current fix.
HSBC’s rich valuation reflects spare buyback ammo,Both Silicon Valley giants are looking for the next big thing after a slowdown in their main product – iPhone sales at Apple and online ads at Alphabet. Lower expectations mean Tim Cook’s outfit has more time to act. Plus: Activist Dan Loeb puts Sony back under the microscope.
Tesla’s $2 bln capital raise repeats sins of past,"U.S. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal on Friday subpoenaed President Donald Trump's tax returns, giving the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service one week to turn over the tax records."
Viewsroom: Apple versus Alphabet,"Thank goodness for traders. Such gratitude is likely to be a novelty for BNP Paribas  Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafé given how woeful these bankers’ performance was in some of the previous quarters. Still, a boost to volatile trading income reported on Thursday helped lift the French lender’s return closer to its 2020 target. Bonnafé will have to maintain the improvement in revenue growth if he is to hit that goal."
U.S. House panel chairman subpoenas Trump's tax returns,"China can scale a 2023 population peak. A new study suggests the country’s populace may top out in about four years, earlier than expected. That’s disheartening for the likes of Mattel, Lego and education companies. But it also reflects a richer, better-educated nation. That, and a workforce bolstered by employees who stay on longer, may soften the blow."
More contempt citations ahead for Trump advisers: senior U.S. Democrat,"Takeover battles are seldom messier than when companies try to pay with stock. In the case of the battle for oil driller Anadarko Petroleum, though, an unsolicited bid from Occidental Petroleum is beating the rival bid from far larger Chevron by a mile, even taking a skeptical approach to Oxy’s prospects."
"U.S. House could slap $25,000 per day contempt fines on Trump advisers: Democrat","Stocks might not be expensive by some standards. It is, after all, impossible to calculate the objective present value of a financial asset with an unknown future cash flow in an unpredictable world. However, equities are unquestionably expensive in the only way that can be counted: relative to the past."
BNP requires more than one-off trading boost,To err is human. Yet Chinese telecom maker Huawei’s mistakes get much more attention than those of its rivals Ericsson and Nokia. The risk for founder Ren Zhengfei is that this scares off his customers.
China will scale its 2023 population peak,"Apple has old age and experience going for it. The $965 billion firm reported on Tuesday a 5 percent decline in quarterly revenue, but it did better than analysts anticipated. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares tanked even as it posted 17 percent growth in the top line. The Silicon Valley giants are both searching for the next big thing. Lower expectations and generous handouts give Apple more cushion."
Occidental is winning Anadarko battle by a mile,"Beyond Meat's market debut may not be to everyone’s taste. The plant-based burger maker is seeking a $1.5 billion valuation after raising its initial public offering target price by about 20 percent. The eco-friendly business has developed a following among consumers. But with former investor Tyson Foods entering the alternative-meat space, investors may have more appetizing options."
Hadas: Stock market money exaggerates uber-profits,"Airbus looks reluctant to kick Boeing when it’s down. Beyond the indignity of exploiting crashes of its rival’s 737 MAX planes in which 346 people died, the 95 billion euro European planemaker will be wary of triggering a price war. And investing in costly new production without firm orders from airlines would squeeze already tight cash flow."
Huawei fracas erodes its European advantage,"Samsung Electronics isn’t mincing words. The South Korean semiconductor manufacturer reported a whopping 60 percent fall in first-quarter operating profit, blaming lower prices for memory chips amid a glut of supply. The abundant usage of “weak” and “slow” in its statement suggest investors may have to wait a while for a rebound."
Apple’s old age beats Google’s adolescence,"Americans are unequal, unheeded and underpaid, the former White House economist argues in his new book “People, Power, and Profits.” He stopped by Breakingviews to discuss why global trade needs a rewrite, Facebook deserves a break-up and socialism is less scary than it sounds."
Beyond Meat’s green IPO could still burn buyers,"U.S. House tax committee Chairman Richard Neal said on Thursday that he will decide by the end of the week whether to subpoena President Donald Trump's tax returns or go to court to obtain the documents, which the administration refuses to hand over."
Airbus struggles to profit from Boeing misery,"Thor, Iron Man and the Hulk are crushing it. The smashing weekend debut of Walt Disney’s “Avengers: Endgame” further strengthens the superheroes’ dominance of Hollywood. Movie-goers looking for a small quiet film will increasingly have to stay at home."
Samsung may stay true to its bleak words,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reasons to both cheer and sigh after Sunday’s general election. The Socialist leader secured a stronger political mandate, but faces lengthy negotiations with possible partners to form a new government. After a third vote in four years, Spain has only a partial solution to its political gridlock."
The Exchange: Joseph Stiglitz,"Subsidies are speeding up a turnaround at BYD. The electric-vehicle maker reported a stupendous 632 percent increase in first-quarter net profit. It will be tricky to pull off a similar manoeuvre next time, as government grants helped to buoy the bottom line to 750 million yuan ($111 million). But investors nonetheless have cause for cautious celebration."
House Democrat weighs subpoena or court case for Trump's taxes,"Joseph Stiglitz does what he does very well. The veteran progressive economist’s latest book provides a solid agenda for traditional centre-left American reformers. However, “People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent” may not be radical enough for today’s challenges."
Manning ordered to appear before new U.S. grand jury as she is freed from jail,"For all the successes of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies, consumer prices are rising more slowly than the central bank’s 2 percent target. Aiming for a lower inflation rate is acceptable in a country where unemployment is low, especially since asset purchases will remain a lever at monetary policymakers’ disposal."

Lesson of Disney’s ‘Endgame’: Go big or go home,"Japan’s imperial retirement bash will test the country’s reluctant spenders. The world's third-largest economy takes a 10-day break, starting on Saturday, as Crown Prince Naruhito ascends to the Chrysanthemum Throne, replacing Emperor Akihito. Travel agents and malls hope for a spending spike, but Japanese workaholics may not turn swiftly into shopaholics. It’s poor news if they don’t, not least for planned efforts to meet rising social security costs.     "
Spanish election half-solves political paralysis,"Jeff Bezos’s first letter to Amazon.com shareholders in 1998 said that “it’s all about the long game.” With revenue of $60 billion over the last three months alone – roughly 100 times what it was in the year Bezos penned that missive – the challenges have changed. To ensure the e-commerce giant’s future, Bezos’s best weapons aren’t sales growth, but sprawl and usefulness."

A gathering in Beijing this week to promote the $1 trillion-plus foreign policy push comes after a bumpy year for the flagship scheme, from Pakistan to Malaysia. Under pressure, China has shown some welcome flexibility. But U.S. hostility is ramping up too, and that will be far harder to repair."
Amazon’s best weapons are sprawl and usefulness,"Instagram is becoming Facebook’s sugar daddy. The $521 billion social network’s image-sharing unit is a big reason for the company’s strong first-quarter top-line growth. There’s room to wedge more revenue-earning ads into users’ feeds. The risk, though, is the distractions and dodgy content that hamper the “old” Facebook spread to Instagram."

Former CIA officer Valerie Plame running for Congress in New Mexico,Did you hear the one about the comedy writer who’s suing U.S. talk-show host Conan O’Brien for allegedly stealing his jokes? It’s the latest case of creative types – from UK band Radiohead to software giant Oracle – using copyright protections to block others from building on their clever but often derivative ideas. Overly strict laws that stifle innovation are no laughing matter.
Democrat Beto O'Rourke hires Obama adviser for 2020 U.S. presidential bid,"Italy irked the United States by backing Beijing’s grand infrastructure plan. The country needs to improve ties with the People’s Republic to sell more wine and other exports, says Rome’s top China expert. Overcoming trade barriers will, however, require an EU team effort."
UK supermarket M&A will return in bargain bin,"Thomas Cook’s best case may be a risky breakup.

How to pick the next Bank of England chief,"Donald Trump is calling in a favour. In November, the American president publicly exonerated Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, over his alleged role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.

Klobuchar pitches pragmatism as she seeks to carve identity in Democratic presidential field,"Deutsche Bank’s tie-up talks with Commerzbank are providing a field day for Europe’s financial balloon-floaters. The latest is the idea that Dutch lender ING Groep has expressed interest in chaining itself to Commerzbank, reported in Germany’s Manager Magazin.

House Democrat to decide Thursday on going to court for Trump tax returns: Politico,"The world’s second-biggest economy may be getting back on track, at least judging by the 35 percent rise in the benchmark CSI300 index  so far this year.

Among the evidence marshalled by the Council of Economic Advisers was the cost of a pickup truck, “one of the most popular personal vehicles in the United States”. As one Danish executive remarked: “I’ve never even seen a pickup in Copenhagen.”"
Overpriced Aramco debt still has a Saudi discount,"Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing has just received an unexpected leg-up from his rival Jean Pierre Mustier, who runs Italy’s UniCredit. Both men are competing for the affections of Commerzbank. The arrival of another suitor puts extra pressure on the German government to back a domestic marriage."
Wynn splurges on a new beginning Down Under,"Canadian canola has exposed Beijing’s limited diplomatic toolkit. Chinese officials are scrutinizing exporters due to quality concerns. Ties are frayed, and the status of the People’s Republic as a giant consumer and trader is one of its few geopolitical levers. Using health and safety rules for political ends, though, undermines watchdogs cleaning up all-too-real violations at home."
Dan Loeb can help Sony handily sharpen its picture,"The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $6 billion worth of weapons sales to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in three separate packages, the Pentagon said on Friday after notifying Congress of the certification."
IMF plays Cassandra to the global economy,"A total hip replacement is an excellent opportunity to put economic theory to a medical test. As the codeine wore off after my successful operation last week, I pondered the validity of some long-standing economic theories. What follows are four lessons I learned from my three days at The Manor Hospital in Oxford, a small private facility where the UK’s National Health Service sent me for this very common surgery."
SocGen trading cuts are just a start,"The lady is for turning after all. After failing for a third time to ram her Brexit deal through parliament last week, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday offered to compromise. Her belated approach to the opposition Labour party, following an all-day cabinet meeting, is a welcome sign that she wants to avoid crashing out of the European Union without a deal. But her pivot still faces at least three obstacles."
Trump says Special Counsel Mueller should not testify on Russia probe,"Samsung Electronics investors seem to be focused on the silver linings rather than two big clouds. South Korea’s $270 billion semiconductor manufacturer already flagged a dismal first quarter because of a glut in memory chips. A more concentrated market means supply cuts could lift prices, but it may take time to overcome stockpiled inventories and weaker demand."
"Bernie Sanders promises help for family farms, rural residents on trip to Iowa",Saudi Aramco is enormous – staggeringly so. Yet by one measure that matters a lot – the $2 trillion valuation envisaged by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – it’s still not enormous enough.
"Trump says he, Putin discussed new nuclear pact possibly including China",Saudi Aramco is enormous – staggeringly so. Yet by one measure that matters a lot – the $2 trillion valuation envisaged by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – it’s still not enormous enough.
Wynn splurges on a new beginning Down Under,"The United States may have hit on an opportunity to push back against China’s harsh cybersecurity law. Beijing could be willing to bargain over rules for how and where companies doing business in the country store data. It would be a surprise softening of its position in trade talks. With more allies on this issue than usual, including in China, Washington has a stronger chance of winning concessions."
America’s opioid legal blitz is a smoking mess,Mark Zuckerberg is realizing more regulation has its merits. The founder and chief executive of $480 billion Facebook wants governments to develop standardized rules for the internet. There’s a lot to be said for the idea. But it also smacks of a way for tech firms to keep profits private while socializing responsibility and costs.
The Exchange: Laurence Boone,Setbacks that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party suffered in Sunday’s local elections will prod him into making the wrong economic policy choices. He is all the more likely now to opt for short-term fixes rather than the more profound changes that investors want but which would take time to combat recession.
UK web rules will speed internet’s balkanisation,Giant lenders like the $290 billion Industrial and Commercial Bank of China are ramping up loans to small businesses at the behest of Beijing. That will check their bias towards large state-owned  enterprises. But it ignores perverse incentives at work within the banks and it is a misguided way to stimulate private investment.

That will check their bias towards large state-owned  enterprises. But it ignores perverse incentives at work within the banks and it is a misguided way to stimulate private investment.
Deutsche Bank’s Brunei hotel ban raises moral bar,"A U.S. senator plans to introduce legislation on Thursday to streamline regulation and permitting requirements for the development of mines for lithium, graphite and other electric-vehicle supply chain minerals, part of a plan to offset China's dominance in the space."
Viewsroom: What’s driving Lyft’s valuation?,"Only one definite conclusion can be drawn from Theresa May’s latest parliamentary defeat. Britain will not leave the European Union on March 29, despite the prime minister’s repeated promises that it would. After lawmakers on Friday voted by a majority of 58 to reject her Brexit deal for the third time, the country will remain part of the bloc for at least another two weeks."
Cox: Danish capitalism is alive but not all well,"Elizabeth Holmes doesn’t blink. At least that’s one of the claims made in the HBO documentary “The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,” released this month. The young founder of blood-testing upstart Theranos, who is set to appear in court later next month to defend criminal charges of fraud, just five years ago sat at the helm of a healthcare technology company worth some $9 billion in the private market. Alex Gibney’s film documents her swift rise and fa"
UniCredit interest gives German bank merger a push,"AstraZeneca is taking a precision approach in the race to treat cancer. The UK drugmaker on Thursday evening said it will pay up to $6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo on a treatment for breast cancer. Compared to the risk of an acquisition, it’s a relatively painless way of expanding in a hot area."
Canola exposes Beijing’s blunt diplomatic tools,African swine fever is testing China’s transparency credentials. Grains trader Cargill is the latest company to cite outbreaks of the highly contagious hog disease as a drag on business. It’s likely to fuel fears that the world’s biggest pork producer may be under-reporting the issue. That taint adds to a fast-spreading problem for Beijing.
State Department OKs nearly $6 billion in weapons sales to Gulf allies,"Peugeot and Renault both seem keen to merge with the Italo-American carmaker. Either deal could improve earnings from smaller cars, but couldn’t plug all Fiat Chrysler’s gaps in Asia and new tech. Plus: Apple’s underwhelming new services. And can Huawei’s charm offensive succeed?"
Trump says did not raise election meddling with Putin in phone call,Swedbank’s attempt to cauterise wounds is unlikely to succeed. Its board on Thursday dismissed Chief Executive Birgitte Bonnesen and appointed Finance Director Anders Karlsson as an acting replacement following allegations that the lender was involved in money laundering in the Baltics. The problem for investors is that the scandal will last longer than her tenure.

The problem for investors is that the scandal will last longer than her tenure.
Hadas: What a new hip taught me about economics,"Beto O’Rourke is a vessel into which many Democrats are pouring their hopes for the next American president. They are attracted by the vibe of integrity, youthful energy, courage and intellect the Texas congressman emits. He has not, however, offered much in the way of detailed policy: No white papers, no prescriptive manifestoes. He is even elusive on some basic questions, like where he stands on healthcare reform. As for the economy, who knows?"
Theresa May’s soft-Brexit pivot has three barriers,Swedbank’s attempt to cauterize wounds is unlikely to succeed.

The problem for investors is that the scandal will last longer than her tenure.
Two big clouds eclipse Samsung's silver lining,"China's 5G noise is scrambling positive signals from ZTE. A three-month ban that stopped U.S. suppliers from selling parts to the telecoms-equipment giant dragged it to a $1 billion loss in 2018. ZTE's Hong Kong shares are up almost 50 percent so far this year anyway, on the promise of next-generation networks. That looks premature.   "
"Saudi Aramco is big, just not big enough",The largest Democratic field in the modern U.S. political era is competing for the party's 2020 presidential nomination.
"Saudi Aramco is big, just not big enough","Human sexuality has no clear lines – a bit like foreign investment controls. The American authorities have classified Grindr, the dating app targeted at gay users, as a security risk because it’s owned by Chinese gaming group Beijing Kunlun Tech, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The fuzzy nature of overseas investment scrutiny means that one review doesn’t dictate the outcome of future ones – but it’s likely that Grindr’s problems will stoke more bad blood in the"
America can define down China’s harsh cyber rules,"Here is something a senior Boeing executive almost certainly never said: “You know how important it is to keep up with Airbus. We’ll have to move fast, even if that means taking a few chances on safety.”"
Zuckerberg’s plea for regulation is a siren call,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles might gain from playing an M&A waiting game. Already the subject of interest from Peugeot of France, the $24 billion carmaker could face a bid from a merged Renault-Nissan, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. Such a deal would be tricky and take time. But patience could give FCA better options to solve its tech and Asian headaches."
Turkey elections pave way for bad economic choices,"China’s property developers are struggling to resist the siren song of tech investing. China Evergrande, a $45 billion giant, reported bumper earnings for last year, along with several major peers, even as overall sales growth slowed. Home prices are rising, debt is stabilising and government policy is friendlier. Shareholders could relax, were developers not plowing the bounty into electric cars and farm technology."
Not all Chinese bank borrowers are made equal,"Apple’s new credit card is a remarkable thing. Not because of the cash back offered to users – they can get similar deals elsewhere. And not because it’s made of titanium and has no numbers printed on it. The unusual thing is that in order to muscle in on a competitive industry, issuer Goldman Sachs has tossed aside many of the features that make the card business lucrative for banks in the first place."
Not all Chinese bank borrowers are made equal,"Uber Technologies’ $3.1 billion acquisition of Middle East rival Careem Networks should give its IPO a boost. It shows the group which is burning cash is still willing to spend to grow. And, by reducing competition in the fast-growing region, it gives potential investors one less thing to worry about."
Exclusive: U.S. seeks to challenge China's electric-vehicle supply chain dominance,"Thailand's chaotic electoral result is near investors' worst case scenario. A vote to end direct military rule has slid into confusion, with accusations of cheating and both main rivals claiming they can form a government. A clear outcome may be weeks away, at best. With foreign funds already selling out of shares, that's a poor prospect for a cooling $460 billion economy."
"Stung by snubs, House Democrats weigh fines for U.S. attorney general","China’s oil majors are filling up at the right time. PetroChina’s losses on gas imports swelled last year, thanks to low rates at home. Yet the $200 billion behemoth and rivals are preparing to buy more liquefied natural gas from the United States anyway. It’s a good way to help defuse trade tension, of course. More importantly, the purchases can lock in supply before an expected shortfall."

Four lessons of Theresa May’s third Brexit defeat,"Apple has one big challenge – create new revenue streams – and many less than convincing solutions. Chief Executive Tim Cook unveiled a dizzying array of new subscription services on Monday that cover news, television and gaming. The $880 billion tech firm introduced a credit card too. The offerings ranged from confusing to mildly innovative."
Review: Theranos story is both crazy and ordinary,"U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to fill a seat on the Federal Reserve, economic commentator Stephen Moore, withdrew from consideration on Thursday after weeks of criticism about his shifting views on interest-rate policy and sexist comments about women."
AstraZeneca takes precision approach to cancer M&A,"The European Central Bank is heading for somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Weakening economic activity is raising the chances of President Mario Draghi’s successor following in the footsteps of the Bank of Japan, which has kept policy rates ultra-low for two decades and adopted ever more radical measures. A “Japanisation” of monetary policy would exact a heavy toll on Europe’s lenders, which would only make the central bank’s job harder."
Swine fever tests China's transparency credentials,"Pinterest’s future relies on pegging global sales growth. The social scrapbooking app has a healthier balance sheet than other startups going public. Revenue growth has outpaced expenses, shrinking its net loss by 65 percent over two years to $63 million. Most of its user expansion, though, comes from overseas enthusiasts, still far less lucrative than those at home."
Viewsroom: Who will drive off with Fiat Chrysler?,"For a man who promised to surround himself “only with the best and most serious people,” Donald Trump has often delivered otherwise, and seen his administration racked by turmoil and ethical criticism. One exception has been the Federal Reserve, where the president has filled vacancies with a string of well-regarded experts, including Chairman Jay Powell."
Swedbank CEO exit still leaves iceberg of problems,"The European Union didn’t kick the Brexit can so much as nudge it. After another late-night summit in Brussels, leaders of 27 EU countries did what they do best and extended the deadline for a difficult decision. But by giving Theresa May’s government only two more weeks to agree a plan for leaving the bloc, they also sharpened Britain’s difficult choices."

Cox: Betonomics would have certain punk-rock edge,"Recent U.S. floods are adding new twists to the 2020 elections. Several midwestern states have suffered some of their worst deluges on record, raising more climate-change fears. That could influence voters in Iowa, a key state in the U.S. presidential-election process. And the floods’ financial toll may prompt underwater farmers to dump President Donald Trump."
Swedbank CEO exit still leaves iceberg of problems,"Putting Deutsche and Commerz together might create a national banking champion. A more likely outcome, though, would be a poorly performing behemoth. Meanwhile, Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess commits the mother of all CEO gaffes. Plus: sizing up a Chinese housing unicorn."
China’s 5G noise scrambles ZTE's positive signals,"Albert Einstein defined insanity as endlessly doing the same thing while expecting a different result. By that yardstick, global investment banks are off their rockers. New year optimism about rising rates and greater volatility boosting markets revenue has been summarily dashed. Instead, trading arms will continue to disappoint."
"Factbox: More than 20 Democrats, two Republicans vie for presidential nomination","Thailand's long-awaited vote may solve just one problem: the poll itself. Sunday's ballot ends five years of direct military rule. For investors, the best outcome is an uncontested one, even if the junta leader stays on as prime minister. A democracy of sorts could well encourage some inward capital flows, and planned infrastructure spending will help growth. Unfortunately, none of the likely winners appear ready to tackle the deeper woes of this sclerotic eco"
House Democrats press probe of Trump security clearances,"Berlin is pushing for the wrong German M&A champion. Officials including Finance Minister Olaf Scholz want to help embattled Deutsche Bank by merging it with Commerzbank. In reality, the combined 26 billion euro lender would probably be just as dysfunctional and still struggle to earn its cost of capital. Encouraging a 102 billion euro auto giant via a union between BMW and Daimler makes more sense."
Senate upholds veto of Yemen resolution in victory for Trump Saudi policy,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr will be subpoenaed if does not appear for a hearing of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries said on Wednesday."
Grindr stokes bad blood in U.S.-China relationship,"Roundup’s noxious effect is leaching deeper into Bayer. Shares in the German chemicals group slumped again on Wednesday after a second U.S. court said its widely used weed killer causes cancer. Bayer has shed $34 billion of market capitalisation since the first adverse ruling last August, effectively exterminating any value in its CropScience unit, which includes Roundup. With thousands of claims in the wings, even that may be too generous."
Hadas: Boeing undermined by too-positive thinking,"CLSA will survive the departure of its bosses. Jonathan Slone is quitting, shortly after its chairman left. The moves have led to whispers of a culture clash with China’s Citic Securities, which bought the Hong Kong brokerage for $1.3 billion in 2013. Bank mergers are always challenging. Still, it’s too early to write this one off."
Fiat Chrysler might gain from M&A waiting game,"Investors and companies are ill prepared for the rising scarcity of this most important natural resource. With World Water Day on March 22, Thirst CEO Mina Guli lays out the issues and explains why she decided to run 100 marathons in 100 days to draw attention to the problem."
China property giants face call of tech sirens,Berlin has blessed the potential union of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank to create a German national champion in financial services. Conventional wisdom holds that the official sanction from the Bundesregierung makes a marriage between the two challenged institutions a done deal. But it’s precisely this sort of statist logic that keeps Europe from developing more globally competitive businesses.
"Apple Card puts customer first, Goldman second","Rugby Union teams awarded a penalty near the opponent’s goal line face a dilemma. Should they kick a penalty between the H-shaped posts and earn an easy three points, or attempt to ground the ball beyond the posts for a so-called try, earning seven? That’s one way to think about the choice between a 500 million pound private equity bid from CVC for the Six Nations Championship, and a more ambitious 5 billion pound plan by governing body World Rugby for a wider gl"
Uber gets an IPO boost from Middle East deal,"Dianrong’s boss has daringly said what many are probably thinking. Guo Yuhang, co-founder and co-chairman of one of China’s biggest peer-to-peer lenders, blamed the government for his company’s sluggishness. Such regulatory grievances are common from bankers elsewhere, but rare in China. The complaints will strike a chord in the industry even if they don’t alter the course of mercurial rules."
Chaotic Thai result is near investors' worst case,"Overexcited, overpaid and over here. The comic line once aimed at American soldiers in Europe also summarises the involvement of U.S. banks in the possible merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. If the deal happens, it could owe much to Wall Street nous."
China’s majors fill up on gas at the right time,"Boeing’s losses are not Airbus’ gains. The $215 billion U.S. aerospace giant may have suspended deliveries of its ill-fated 737 MAX 8 jet after two crashes in five months, and that theoretically should benefit its European peer. Unfortunately for 91 billion euro Airbus, chock-full production lines and order books stretching for years mean it can’t take up much slack."
China’s majors fill up on gas at the right time,"Things are getting testier at Japan Inc. In a rare act of domestic corporate aggression, trading house Itochu snatched a degree of control over $1.8 billion sportswear maker Descente. Toshiba, meanwhile, faces a shareholder insurrection while electronics group Alps Alpine has been sued over the merger that created the company. These hostilities are helping propel Shinzo Abe’s so-called third arrow."
"Apple stretches to take on Netflix, Amex, Disney","Mark Zuckerberg’s inner circle just got smaller. Chris Cox, the Facebook chief executive's long-time lieutenant and chief product officer, is quitting after Zuckerberg last week outlined a new direction for the $470 billion social network. It’s hard to overstate how instrumental Cox has been. His departure is a wake-up call for investors."
Trump Fed pick Moore withdraws from consideration,"As Democrats weigh a field of 20 White House hopefuls that includes candidates who would be the youngest or oldest president ever elected, new Reuters/Ipsos polling shows age could be a liability at either end of the spectrum."
Not so fast: Trump’s Alaska drilling study slammed by U.S. wildlife regulator,"On the face of it, the English Premier League is on a high. Millions of fans worldwide watch its matches every weekend, and its 20 member clubs generate as much revenue as their Spanish and Italian rivals combined. Half of the eight quarter finalists in this year’s UEFA Champions League are from England."
Florida teachers can arm themselves under new gun bill,"Volkswagen’s  Herbert Diess has effortlessly claimed pole position on the grid of foot-in-mouth chief executives. The boss of the 74 billion euro carmaker on Thursday apologised for evoking a Nazi slogan by saying “EBIT macht frei”, and was forced to acknowledge that his company’s dark history gave it a “special responsibility in connection with the Third Reich”. Call it peak gaffe."
“Japanisation” of ECB will blight Europe’s banks,"It may have taken a while, but Hong Kong finally showcased an investor-protection edge. The financial regulator banned UBS from leading market debuts for a year, and the Swiss bank and three of its peers will pay $100 million in fines for shoddy due diligence on initial public offerings stretching back to 2009. As bourses battle to host the next wave of unproven startups, the city’s aegis provides a bit of extra comfort."
Pinterest’s future relies on pegging global sales,"Facebook's presidential foes are also its customers. Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats running for the White House have turned Silicon Valley into a political punching bag, but their campaigns are big users of Facebook and other online platforms. It reflects the power of tech giants and suggests bashing them may not persuade voters. "
Trump takes politics to heart of Fed with nominee,"Elon Musk’s balancing act requires some capital support. On Thursday evening the chief executive plans to unveil Tesla’s latest vehicle, the Model Y SUV. But it could steal sales from the Model 3 sedan, whacking Tesla’s earnings when it can least afford it. It’s a fresh complication as Musk fights with the Securities and Exchange Commission and flip-flops over store closures. A cash injection could help smooth the ride."
Brexit extension sharpens Britain’s choices,"The U.S. aircraft maker is facing a crisis after a second crash involving an updated version of its workhorse 737 jet. There’s a financial hit to Boeing from countries grounding the plane; but there are geopolitical implications, too. Plus: China tries to stimulate its economy."
China’s majors fill up on gas at the right time,"There’s no getting around Ben van Beurden’s extremely large bonus. Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday that its chief executive would receive 19.8 million euros in direct pay, more than double 2017’s 8.5 million euros, with the major shift via a near-quadrupling of his so-called long-term incentive plan. Unless one takes a moral approach to gargantuan pay awards, the bigger problem is not size but length."
U.S. floods add new twists to 2020 elections,Spotify is pitching its complaint against Apple to a willing European audience. The Swedish music-streaming service has told antitrust regulators that its rival stifles competition. A case may take years. But the Stockholm-based group has adeptly timed its move to coincide with a broader backlash in Europe against U.S. Big Tech.
Viewsroom: German bank M&A’s questionable logic,"Pinduoduo is giving New York investors a taste of Shanghai. The $29 billion e-commerce outfit, a mainland variation on coupon company Groupon, has all the ingredients of Chinese tech: promise, growth - and plenty of volatility. Shares fell more than 17 percent on Wednesday, after it spent far more than expected last year to lure and retain customers. The experience of rivals like Alibaba, though, suggests better times ahead."
Traders’ brave new world shrinks to same old story,"Boeing's belatedly grounded jets are an apt symbol of the erosion of U.S. soft power. After saying there was no problem in the wake of two crashes, the most recent on Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday grounded Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft. The FAA usually shows the way, but many other governments had already banned the planes."
Thailand's vote may solve just one problem,"President Donald Trump, in perhaps his most unorthodox statement yet on monetary policy, called for the U.S. Federal Reserve to act as if the country was back in the throes of recession, with sharp interest rate cuts and renewed ""quantitative easing"" to pump trillions of dollars into the economy."
BMW-Daimler: a more logical German M&A champion,"The children of rich parents have always had a leg up at elite U.S. universities. A college-bribe scandal, and the entitlement on show by the parents involved, exposes one more way U.S. higher education was tilted toward the 1 percent."
Barr will be subpoenaed if he fails to appear at House hearing: Democrat,"When Goldman Sachs goes on the defensive, someone must be attacking with force. The Wall Street firm just published research that tries to clear up some negative “misperceptions” about corporate share repurchases. For many critics of contemporary capitalism, stock buybacks have become emblematic of a corrupt system. As far as this particular practice goes, the critics have a good case."
Trump seeks huge boost in emergency funds for migrant surge,"Techno music from a portable speaker sounded the alarm at 1 p.m. sharp on Saturday, in front of the McDonald’s at Charles de Gaulle airport. Dozens of men and women quickly donned the yellow vests, or gilets jaunes, that have become the uniform of a movement which has for 17 weeks galvanized the French Republic and defied President Emmanuel Macron’s government."
U.S. military not given orders to prepare for war in Venezuela,"“Break up Big Tech” could become a slogan in the U.S. 2020 presidential elections if Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren has her way. But a report for the British government on Wednesday proposed a smarter way to tackle the dominance of behemoths such as Facebook, Google and Amazon."
Legal woes poison Bayer’s prospects,"Ping An’s share repurchase comes with a Beijing twist. China’s biggest insurer by market value plans to buy up to $1.5 billion of its Shanghai shares. The company, which has a Hong Kong listing too, says it’s undervalued. But this transaction also responds to an official push to bolster mainland markets. Shareholders benefitted this time, but such policy winds can blow both ways."
Citic and CLSA will survive boss departure,"Britain is stretching out its journey to an unknown final destination. Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s blueprint for leaving the European Union for a second time on Tuesday. With only 17 days to go until the official departure date, buying more time is the probable next step, and the least painful way forward."
The Exchange: The water-crisis marathoner,"Boeing may need to ground its own aircraft. Europeans joined the Chinese and others in suspending flights of the 737 Max 8 after two crashes in recent months, and two U.S. senators called on the Federal Aviation Administration to follow suit. Boeing’s stock lost a further 6 percent, lopping off $14 billion or so of market value, on Tuesday. Rather than waiting for its regulator, the company could get ahead of the crisis."
"Cox: Really, no one else will bid for Commerzbank?","Techno music from a portable speaker sounded the alarm at 1pm sharp on Saturday, in front of the McDonald’s at Charles de Gaulle airport.

Rugby’s dilemma: take the penalty or go for a try,"Renault and Nissan Motor’s Yokohama love-in swerves around the main issues with the carmakers’ alliance. The French auto group has agreed its chair will no longer hold the same position at its Japanese partner, as it did under former leader Carlos Ghosn. But wider talk of equality is no substitute for solving the alliance’s fundamental problems."
Dianrong boss daringly says what many are thinking,"Meituan Dianping has driven, and pedalled, itself to distraction. The $42 billion Chinese super-app operator grew the top line by an impressive 89 percent in the fourth quarter, as its all-important food delivery business shows new signs of strength against Alibaba-owned Ele.me. Other ventures increasingly seem like costly diversions."
German bank champion will be made on Wall Street,"President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization have sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp to try to block them from responding to U.S. congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records."
Airbus can only nibble at Boeing’s 737 lunch,"Weijian Shan spent his youth labouring in the Gobi Desert. Now he runs $30 bln at PAG, after stints at TPG and the World Bank. One of the first Chinese to study in America after the Cultural Revolution, Shan discusses trade tensions, and the economic risk of historical amnesia."
Hostile Japanese deal propels Abe’s third arrow,"Silicon Valley’s biggest companies should get in the tent with U.S. regulators. Lawmakers and politicians keen to run for president are considering ways to break up Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet's Google and even Apple. Companies fighting constraints rather than trying to shape them may regret it."
Facebook departure is a wake-up call for investors,"They’re counting the cranes over Dublin again. A decade after Ireland’s devastating property crash, the capital city’s skyline is once again a display of frantic construction activity. In January journalists at the Irish Times spotted more than 100 cranes from the newspaper’s offices, triple the number three years earlier."
Most Democrats say age is not just a number for White House candidates: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"Chinese financial xenophobia has thrown a wrench in MSCI's plans to offer up smaller local companies. Days after expanding the weight of mainland shares in its benchmarks, the index provider had to drop a popular tech stock thanks to policies capping foreign shareholdings. If happens too often, its indexes will be less representative of demand, and economic reality."
Deadline expires for DOJ to give Congress full Mueller report,"So much for pan-European unity. Deutsche Bank  is in merger talks with domestic rival Commerzbank. Chief Executive Christian Sewing was forced into acting sooner than he’d have liked due to concerns that other banks, including France’s BNP Paribas, might also covet the 8 billion euro lender. A hint of nationalism may play well with German policymakers. But the banks will still need to explain how a deal makes sense for shareholders."
Democrats' suit against Trump over foreign payment can proceed: judge,"Norway has taken a step in the right direction, but then slipped on an oily patch. Oslo on Friday finally answered a question that had kept climate change watchers on tenterhooks: whether its $1 trillion Government Pension Fund Global would continue to invest in oil and gas stocks. Its equivocal response represents a missed opportunity."
Review: UK soccer’s crunching financial challenge,"Fiscal restraint is going out of fashion. In his new book “Austerity”, Harvard professor Alberto Alesina sets out to explain when it’s needed. He tells Breakingviews of the hidden long-term risks of U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies and why Italy’s debt risks are not over."
Volkswagen CEO’s Nazi pun constitutes peak gaffe,"The world of casualised work is in a state of flux. Companies like Uber  have become global giants by tapping so-called gig workers, but face challenges to the way they treat these “employees”. “Will the Gig Economy Prevail?” by Colin Crouch is timely, but its analysis misses some significant recent developments, while proposed reforms underplay deeper trends."
Crackdown on banks gives Hong Kong an IPO edge,"Hong Kong is home to an unlikely champion of gender equality. Even as more disappointing statistics about corporate diversity roll in this International Women’s Day, the venerable Hang Seng Bank can stand proud. Its shares have outperformed under three consecutive female chief executives and a cohort of female directors. A no-nonsense approach sets a strong example for companies everywhere."

Elon Musk’s balancing act requires capital support,"New York's governor assailed President Donald Trump on Monday for backing the National Rifle Association in its dispute with the state, accusing the U.S. leader of being afraid of the powerful gun lobby."
Viewsroom: Boeing’s struggles,"The three-way takeover fight involving Newmont, Barrick Gold and Goldcorp is full of aggression and big egos. Breakingviews columnists unpick the gold-mining M&A frenzy and debate whether cooler heads can prevail. Plus: China telecom giant Huawei has a public-relations challenge."
Shell CEO’s bonus problem less size than length,"Beijing is striking the right balance on stimulus. The government lowered its growth target at the opening of its annual parliament and rolled out a big tax cut. It also signaled that officials will keep a hawkish eye on debt. It’s an effective, if awkward, way to support the economy."
Spotify pitches Apple lament to easy EU audience,"Kraft Heinz shares reached their zenith two years ago, the day Unilever rejected an unwanted takeover approach from the aggressive maker of ketchup and processed cheese. Its Anglo-Dutch quarry’s stock also got a boost. How the tables have turned. The Cheez Whiz giant has melted down since offering to buy Unilever: its $40 billion market value is now just a quarter of its erstwhile prey’s. Unilever, meantime, has blossomed into a $155 billion behemoth."
Pinduoduo offers New York a Shanghai bargain,"European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is trying his best to be a buddy to banks. His motive: to revive slowing euro zone growth and low inflation by ensuring there are no barriers to consumers and businesses obtaining credit. But with friends like these, lenders hardly need enemies."
Belated 737 action marks U.S. soft power erosion,"Melrose Industries’ magic touch is missing from its latest deal. The UK engineer, which swallowed 8 billion pound rival GKN last year, boosted sales and margins without slashing investment. Still, a sluggish car industry could challenge its acquisition-driven model."
"As Fed meets, Trump calls for sharp rate cut, stimulus",Mizuho’s harsh medicine gives investors a taste of Japanese banking ills. The country’s second-biggest lender by assets took a $6 billion hit and slashed its annual profit forecast on Wednesday by 86 percent. Losses on dozy rural branches and duff offshore trades are symptomatic of ultra-loose monetary policy. New rules to ease consolidation should at least offer some relief.
"Senators blast 'insane' Trump plan for aid cuts, seek Venezuela plan","MMT may be on the road to economic respectability. However, most established economists are still not impressed by so-called modern monetary theory. A to-and-fro debate has erupted between Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University, an MMT proponent, and Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner and “conventional Keynesian”."
"With Biden in, crowded 2020 Democratic field starts to get feisty","The course of central banking rarely runs smoothly these days. Take the roughly 2 trillion euros of government debt that the European Central Bank bought to help the euro zone economy. While the plan worked, new analysis shows some of the liquidity flowed in surprising ways that diluted its effectiveness."
College-bribe scandal is manna for progressives,"Automaker Nio is on a roll, delivering more than 11,000 units in its first year of sales. Tesla’s Chinese rival benefits from government subsidies, and from drivers’ enthusiasm for premium electric cars. But other up-and-coming brands are hurrying new models to market this year, putting Nio to the test."
Hadas: Share buybacks aren't worth defending,Theresa May’s so-called Brexit bribe is unlikely to sway hearts and minds. The UK prime minister promised to invest 1.6 billion pounds in impoverished English towns. Critics see it as a bung to get opposition lawmakers to back her EU exit deal. But the paltry investment might only draw attention to the damage that May’s Brexit has already done the UK.
Cox: A Saturday outing with France’s gilets jaunes,"U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke attacked the close ties between Republican President Donald Trump and Fox News on Sunday, saying the White House has ""free rein, almost"" over what is broadcast on the cable television network."
Britain shows United States how to fight Big Tech,"Ever since uppity investor Elliott Advisors turned up at Pernod Ricard late last year, Paris has been awash with talk that LVMH is lurking somewhere behind the gilded curtains, waiting to pounce on the $46 billion spirits group. The rumours reached a fever pitch in February when an equity research firm published a report detailing the potential financial benefits that might accrue from such a deal."
Ping An stock repurchase comes with Beijing twist,"The rare Asiatic lion is no match for India's democracy. In the 2009 general election, a polling station was set up for a single voter in a wildlife sanctuary where big cats roam free. Officials go to ever-greater extremes to ensure voters in the world's largest democracy can cast their ballots, erecting booths in snow-capped mountains and in Maoist rebel-affected areas. Unfortunately politicians, also known as netas, show no similar enthusiasm for stamping out c"
Britain positions for longer Brexit limbo,"Democratic governments are good for justice and bad for the economy, while competitive markets are just a good thing. Or perhaps it is the other way around. The debate on the relationship between electoral politics and rising standards of living is long-standing and has a new urgency. “Democracy and Prosperity: Reinventing Capitalism through a Turbulent Century” persuasively argues that the two are mutually supportive."
Boeing needs to think faster than its watchdog,"Investors in the stricken solar giant Hanergy Thin Film Power, whose Hong Kong shares were suspended almost four years ago, have been offered a false hope. A company proposal on Tuesday looks at first glance like a creative way to evade near-certain delisting. Shareholders can swap untradeable Hanergy stock for stakes in a special purpose vehicle, intended to facilitate a new listing in China. That could give backers a chance to recover at least part of their "
Cox: A Saturday outing with France’s gilets jaunes,American government officials attending this year’s Mobile World Congress at least avoided endorsing the company they had come to lobby against. The delegation from the U.S. State Department brought their own lanyards to the telecom industry’s annual shindig to avoid wearing the standard-issue passes bearing the name of conference sponsor Huawei. 
Renault-Nissan love-in swerves main bumps in road,"Investors in the stricken solar giant Hanergy Thin Film Power, whose Hong Kong shares were suspended almost four years ago, have been offered a false hope.

Shareholders can swap untradeable Hanergy stock for stakes in a special purpose vehicle, intended to facilitate a new listing in China.

Meituan Dianping drives itself to distraction,"It’s time for a treaty on the yuan. The United States paid a price for Beijing’s past manipulation, and making currency policy part of any future trade deal is a good idea. Although the world’s second-largest economy gets fewer benefits from a suppressed rate than it once did, another round of forced depreciation is not inconceivable."
"Escalating fight, Trump sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One over Democratic subpoenas","Elon Musk is firing up the engine for a battle with short sellers. The Tesla chief executive is finally selling Model 3s for $35,000 a pop – and shutting most of the firm’s stores to pay for it. That means it will soon be clear whether he has indeed built the profitable mass-market electric-car maker that he has long promised, or a business fast running out of juice as his Wall Street foes contend."
Trump directs officials to toughen asylum rules,"Kraft Heinz’s poor earnings, $15 bln writedown and accounting investigation forced the Berkshire Hathaway boss to admit he overpaid for the nuts-to-Velveeta cheese purveyor. Breakingviews columnists discuss what went wrong. Plus: Trump buys more time in his China trade spat."
Foxconn chairman travels to White House to discuss Wisconsin: source,"The U.S. economy isn’t quite allowing President Donald Trump a victory lap. But nor is it providing much fodder for critics. GDP growth slowed in the last quarter of 2018, still almost hitting the administration’s 3 percent target for the full year. The president, the Federal Reserve and market watchers can all take what they want from that."
"The Exchange: Out of the desert, into a trade war","U.S. congressman Seth Moulton, one of 20 Democrats running for president, criticized rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Friday, saying they were so liberal they risked handing President Donald Trump a second White House term."
Big Tech's best bet is to friend U.S. regulation,"European telecoms consolidation is rumbling along, and Liberty Global Chairman John Malone is once again taking his chips off the table. The “cable cowboy” and his Chief Executive Mike Fries are selling sub-scale cable businesses to mobile companies at rich valuations. They’re banking upfront the benefits that buyers hope to reap by bundling together the different services, and likely getting the better side of the bargain."
Brexit tips Ireland into economic purgatory,"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is primed for some M&A trades. The $43 billion bourse operator enjoyed a blowout 2018, but its three-year strategic plan unveiled on Thursday offers few bold ideas for reducing dependence on trading in local equities. Looming Chinese reforms pose a further threat. A trio of new blue-chip advisers may be able to help."
Chinese stock xenophobia is a problem for MSCI,"The fact Kraft Heinz's share price has fallen almost one-third since last Friday suggests investors were shocked by its jumbo serving of bad news, which included a dividend cut and a big goodwill writedown. They should not even have been surprised."
French incursion jumpstarts Deutsche-Commerz talks,"Driving a hard bargain could backfire on Hyundai. The South Korean conglomerate's auto-parts business has offered less than half the $2.2 billion in dividends wanted by pushy U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management. Meanwhile, Hyundai's carmaker rejected another of the activist's proposals. These stingier options may ultimately cost it investor support when it comes to a broader restructuring."
Norway’s mega-fund fluffs move away from crude,"In some weddings, there’s an obvious winner. Ocado  would do better than Marks and Spencer  if the two UK grocers go ahead with a joint venture that could see the latter paying a hefty price to secure a much-needed delivery service."
The Exchange: Austerity in the age of populism,"Peugeot maker PSA Group has been the best of a bad bunch among European carmakers. The French group’s shares are up about 20 percent in the past year, compared with a 10 percent fall for Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler’s 25 percent decline. Yet Chief Executive Carlos Tavares’ purring engine risks running out of gas."
Review: Gig-economy firms tread precarious path,"Stock buybacks are often a silly financial engineering game, but in Japan they warrant serious consideration. Nintendo shows how they can be played to winning effect."
Hong Kong bank showcases the XX factor,"Be careful what you wish for. That’s the phrase haunting the world’s largest investment banks as they lick their wounds after a painful fourth quarter. For years, bankers complained that markets were too calm. But when bonds and stocks tumbled in the last few months of 2018, almost all trading divisions suffered. It doesn’t bode well for business if markets stay choppy."
Hong Kong bank showcases the XX factor,"Procrastination could bring Britain’s Brexit dilemma to a head. Theresa May on Sunday again delayed the crucial vote on her deal to leave the European Union, shunting it to March 12 – little more than a fortnight before the UK’s official departure date. If the Prime Minister still can’t command a majority, some parliamentarians want her to postpone Brexit. More time won’t make Britain’s hard choices any easier, but might help to rule out the worst option."
New York officials hit back at Trump over backing NRA,"U.S. President Donald Trump's hard line on Beijing is softening by the minute. He has tweeted that he will delay hiking tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, citing ""substantial progress"" on trade talks. He’s easing up on telecoms giant Huawei too. Stock market wobbles have pushed the president toward a quick-and-dirty settlement that will empower Chinese conservatives."
"At first 2020 event, Biden sets up battle with Trump over union vote","President Donald Trump is flatly refusing to cooperate in numerous U.S. congressional probes of himself and his administration, taking a defiant stance that could trigger protracted court fights with House of Representatives Democrats."
Attorney general balks at closed-door testimony on Mueller findings,"From venerable newspapers to upstart challengers, news organizations are getting clobbered by Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. In “Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts,” Jill Abramson effectively draws upon two digital newbies and two well-known media brands to illustrate that the path to survival lies in signing up subscribers. The old guard, however, is better equipped to fight back."
Viewsroom: Hostile gold diggers,"Barrick's latest gamble looks like fool's gold. The Canadian giant is eyeing a bid for its $19 billion U.S. rival Newmont Mining, the Globe and Mail reported on Friday, a tie-up which has been mooted before and could yield synergies. But the buyer has just acquired Randgold Resources, the target is buying Goldcorp, and investors in the sector are wary of scale for the sake of it."
Beijing strikes the right balance on stimulus,"China’s curbs on Australian coal are sending some smog into the southern hemisphere. At least one big port appears to have barred imports of the stuff from Down Under, and customs delays have been lengthening. Beijing has used such tactics in the past to reduce stockpiles and support domestic prices. But denting a top export earner is likely to be interpreted as a diplomatic message too, when ties with Canberra are already strained."
Cox: Unilever can’t help but mull a Kraft pounce,Foreign carmakers are closing some UK plants as lawmakers defect from both the Labour and ruling Tory parties. How will this affect the looming deadline to quit the EU? Plus: Vegan diets are more than a fad.
"With friends like Draghi, banks don’t need enemies","What’s the best way to play the impeachment of the U.S. president? That’s a question that investors are pondering as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Donald Trump’s ties with Russia, and other stuff, finishes up."
Melrose’s latest deal is missing its magic touch,"In the Catholic catechism, a “just war” restores moral order rather than merely exacting revenge. Corporate crusader Edward Bramson has reason for bloodlust given the losses he has sustained since he disclosed a 5 percent stake in Barclays nearly a year ago. But his battle to capture a board seat and cut the investment bank down to size is on shakier ground after a broadly robust fourth quarter."
Mizuho’s harsh medicine gives taste of Japan ills,"    Lenovo's reboot could run low on battery. The world's top PC-maker more than doubled pre-tax earnings in the December quarter from a year earlier, confirming a turnaround under boss Yang Yuanqing is underway. That's mostly powered by cost cuts in the $9 billion group's handset and server units. But with demand cooling for both, a Lenovo comeback may be difficult to sustain."
Hadas: A bluffer’s guide to the MMT debate,"American companies are looking weak when it comes to technological innovation. When it comes to corporate earnings, however, it’s a whole different story."
ECB stimulus flows show why Draghi works so hard,"Walmart may be the smallest loser in the UK supermarket shakeout. British competition watchdogs released a damning view on the 7.3 billion pound tie-up of J Sainsbury and Asda, owned by the U.S. giant. The verdict leaves both groups struggling to fend off discounters Aldi or Lidl. At least Asda has its parent’s global clout."
"Nio’s right place, right time may be short-lived",Brexiteers like to describe the 'sunlit uplands' awaiting the nation’s departure from the European Union. Investors in the country’s largest retail bank aren’t so sure. Lloyds Banking Group  shares look cheap when weighed against CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio’s plan to hit a 15 percent return on equity. That relies on a steep fall in one-off costs and an easy Brexit.
May offers tiny plaster for gaping Brexit wound,"Stephen Moore, U.S. President Donald's Trump pick to fill a vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, says he will continue to pursue his nomination even as a trail of his dismissive comments about women and the Midwest have sparked renewed criticism by Democratic lawmakers."
Democrat O'Rourke accuses Trump White House of dictating Fox News content,"China bears and bulls can pick their data in the Year of the Pig. Stock markets are charging; bonds defaulting. Lunar New Year holiday spending was weak, but January exports boomed. State-owned companies and contradictory industrial and monetary policies are muddying traditional performance measures. They betray an economy going in two directions at once."
Democratic presidential contender Hickenlooper aims to fight monopolies,"Women hold too few roles in corporate America, especially in engineering and computer science. Verizon’s Genia Wilbourn joins Breakingviews to discuss how she and the telecom company are addressing that, from diversity training to influencing suppliers to the CEO’s crucial role."
"FBI, IRS raid on Baltimore mayor prompts calls for resignation","The latest diet trend may prove more durable than previous fads. Concerns about climate change and animal welfare - as well as healthy eating - are prompting more consumers to embrace veganism. Like the low-carb trend of the early 2000s, companies are scrambling to keep up with changing consumer tastes. But the shift to shunning animal products looks more than a flash in the pan."
LVMH-Pernod bid talk makes for watery cocktail,"Coco Chanel once remarked that “fashion passes, style remains”. The French billionaire brothers who own Chanel will undoubtedly replay those words in their heads as the fashion industry mourns Karl Lagerfeld’s passing. The iconic German designer, who for 36 years led the catwalk for the Parisian fashion house, was 85. A normal company might use the occasion to sell the business while it’s still enviously coveted. But a deal looks a long way off."
India Insight: Money power is choking democracy,"A charmed life is one unaffected by the vicissitudes of modern existence. Take HSBC for example. Almost alone among battered European lenders, the London-listed bank’s shares trade at a chunky 20 percent premium to its tangible book value despite delivering returns below its likely 10 percent cost of capital. Annual results delivered on Tuesday offered only a little comfort."
Review: Capitalism and democracy are good friends,"Sometimes money isn’t enough. Beijing may offer to buy more semiconductors from the United States, a move that underscores the challenges it has faced in its bid to make advanced ones at home. Industrial policies like Made in China 2025 draw fury abroad, but the People’s Republic’s scant progress in churning out high-tech chips suggests it’s unclear if such measures even work. "
Stricken Hanergy drops investors into black hole,"Britain’s new centrist breakaway is a long way from the country’s “Emmanuel Macron” moment. The defection of seven politicians from the left-wing Labour party on Monday invites comparisons with the political realignment that eventually propelled the French President to power. But Britain’s political system penalises small parties. The split probably strengthens Prime Minister Theresa May, and may even help her Brexit deal."
Europe is better off policing than banning Huawei,"“It’s just business” may be difficult for Vincent Bolloré to utter. Vivendi, the media group he controls, is sore about the work JPMorgan  did with activist investor Elliott Advisors in last year’s Telecom Italia  saga. The grudge may rear its head in one of the biggest European deals of 2019."
Stricken Hanergy drops investors into black hole,"Britain has thrown Huawei a European lifeline. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has decided it can manage the risks from using the Chinese giant's kit to build next-generation 5G wireless networks, the Financial Times says. That would make London the first major power to challenge Washington’s campaign against the telecoms equipment-to-smartphone maker. It may not be the last."
The yuan belongs in a U.S.-China trade pact,"Donald Trump has started another war of sorts – this time at home. Congress rejected the U.S. president’s demands to fund a southern border barrier, so on Friday he declared a national emergency, a move that will face an array of legal challenges. It’s a messy non-deal considering Trump turned down a compromise providing $25 billion for his wall in 2018."
Elon Musk fires up engine for short-seller battle,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that U.S. talks with North Korea would be ""bumpy,"" but expressed hope there would be several more chances to discuss how to move forward to the country's denuclearization."
Viewsroom: Warren Buffett eats crow,"Ryanair  is notorious for keeping costs low, but its chief executive’s new incentive scheme is anything but frugal. The budget airline has granted Michael O’Leary share options that could be worth almost 100 million euros if he doubles Ryanair’s net profit or share price by 2024. Though the target looks demanding, it’s well within reach."
U.S. economy offers something for everyone,"Whatever the outcome of Nigeria’s tight Feb. 16 election, the next leader of Africa’s most important country will be four times older than his average compatriot. Given the need to rejuvenate a moribund, oil-dependent economy, that’s not ideal. Opposition challenger Atiku Abubakar is hardly a breath of fresh air and has a graft-tainted reputation, but his talk of relaxing the state’s grip on the currency and oil sector is at least a step in the right century."
"Democratic 2020 candidate Moulton says Sanders, Warren too liberal to beat Trump","Spaniards face an uncomfortable choice between political paralysis and separatist confrontation. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday called a snap election for April 28 after the country’s parliament refused to support his budget. His right-wing opponents, if victorious, could provoke a flare-up in tensions with Catalan secessionists."
"Trump pulling U.S. out of U.N. arms treaty, heeding NRA","Ant Financial has taken a big step into Europe amid a global backlash against Chinese technology. Jack Ma's $150 billion payments-to-wealth management group has snapped up WorldFirst in the UK. The deal, which comes a year after a failed bid for U.S.-based MoneyGram, revives Ant's overseas push. But heightened European anxiety about China suggests future acquisitions may not be so easy to close."
White House consents to congressional interview of ex-staffer on security,"Amazon.com and New York City have shot themselves and each other in the foot. The $800 billion e-commerce giant on Thursday decided to ditch its plans to open a second headquarters, known as HQ2, in the Big Apple after local opposition to the $3 billion in state and city incentives it would receive. It makes Amazon look short-term greedy and not interested in community concerns. Politicians, meanwhile, have cost New York both tax revenue and up to 40,000 jobs."
John Malone wins most in Europe’s telco M&A whirl,Falling house prices and slowing Chinese growth are putting Australia’s record of almost 28 years of economic expansion at risk. The banking industry got dinged after a gripping year-long investigation. And a change of government looks likely. Breakingviews dives into the issues.
Hong Kong exchange primed for some M&A trades,"The giants of the internet cannot regulate themselves. They need some help.    The problems are numerous, and not entirely recent. The extensive market power and possibly unfair competition practiced by the likes of Alphabet’s Google, Facebook  and to some extent Amazon  are basically new twists on familiar antitrust questions. But the issues raised by big data are quite new.    Information about tastes and opinions has been gathered, sold, used and misused witho"
Hadas: The CEO guide to corporate old age,"European politicians, as well as passengers who appreciate more leg room, will lament Airbus  sounding the death-knell of the A380. Few others will shed tears for the gas-guzzling behemoth. As with the supersonic Concorde, another engineering marvel, the superjumbo owed more to regional political ambition than commercial logic. The aerospace group can now focus on closing its valuation gap with U.S. rival Boeing  by churning out more of the nimbler, greener two-e"
Driving hard bargain could backfire on Hyundai,"TPG’s Asian fundraising is a sign of the times for buyout shops. The U.S. private equity firm co-led by Jim Coulter slightly exceeded a $4.5 billion target for its new fund despite poor returns in the region. New leadership in Australia and China provides some reassurance. Still, such success after relative failure is a telltale sign of a frothy market. "
Ocado will do better than M&S out of a tie-up,"New Yorkers aren’t known for their avoidance of conflict. Amazon has waded into a spat with the city over incentives it won in return for choosing New York as the location for half of its second headquarters, known as HQ2. The fact that other big companies have created jobs without such fanfare weakens Amazon’s hand, but the Big Apple deserves one more shot."
Cruising Peugeot risks running out of gas,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday he cannot comply with a demand by a House of Representatives committee to turn over President Donald Trump's tax returns ""until it is determined to be consistent with law."""
Nintendo plays winning Japanese buyback game,"Even a divided America seems to agree that the federal prohibition of cannabis deserves a rethink. Six in 10 people say the use of marijuana should be legalized, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. On Wednesday, a congressional hearing approached that question only obliquely. But its narrow focus is more likely to lead to action - and deliver what the industry really needs."
Investment banks have a problem with volatility,"In “The Globotics Upheaval” Richard Baldwin predicts machine learning and instant communications will disrupt service workers just as automation and offshoring upended Western factories. He tells Breakingviews what’s coming, and what we can do to slow it down."
Delaying tactics could bring Brexit to a head,"Just over 300 years ago, in early December 1718, a Parisian bank was nationalised by the French state. This marked the beginning of the Mississippi Bubble, which captivated France over the following couple of years. The aristocratic world of the “ancien regime” may seem impossibly distant to modern minds. Yet there are parallels between this saga and the modern age of quantitative easing, ultra-low interest rates and highly valued asset prices. As central bankers"
U.S. stocks daze Trump into folding on China,"Chinese banks are wise to resist maxing out their credit cards. Lenders have issued hundreds of millions of them to local consumers, facilitating debt-fuelled shopping sprees. It’s a lucrative but risky supplement to other types of loans, and some now appear to be pulling back."
Factbox: Trump stonewalls House Democrats on multiple probes,"Starbucks has had two nationwide shutdowns in its history. The first one, 11 years ago, saw 135,000 baristas retrained in the “art of the espresso” at roughly 7,000 U.S. stores to revive customer service and combat flagging sales. The second Starbucks shutdown was last year. For four hours, 175,000 U.S. employees in 50 states participated in racial-bias training, following an incident in a Philadelphia store where two African-American patrons were wrongly arrested"
Pompeo aims to lift State Dept. morale with 'ethos' statement,"Pinduoduo's search for calm will go on. Even by Chinese tech company standards, the $31 billion e-commerce outfit, which pushes group discounts on everything from fresh produce to clothes, has had a volatile start since it went public in July. A further $1 billion equity, raised on Friday, is a welcome step towards easing wild price swings. But ballooning losses, competition with Alibaba, and legal woes will continue to create a stir."
"Like Trump, Democrat Buttigieg bills himself as a turnaround expert","Andy Purdy, who previously worked in academia and for the U.S. government, talks about the geopolitical edge to allegations about Beijing’s influence at Chinese tech group Huawei, and how communications equipment needs global standards and better testing across the board."
Review: Old news guard beats back the grim reaper,What’s good for the goose is supposed to be good for the gander. Not in central banking. Inflation has slowed in the United States and the euro zone and looks likely to subside further. That’s a boon for Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell but a bane for European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
"Barrick gamble is one part logic, two parts folly","For global technology giants looking for growth, India was supposed to be an easier hunting ground than China. But New Delhi’s plan to compel the likes of Facebook and Alphabet's Google to actively police user-generated content threatens free speech. Coming after edicts that limit foreign giants Amazon and Walmart in e-commerce, the rules suggest India may not be a much easier bet than the People's Republic. "
China coal curbs blow diplomatic smog Down Under,"Howard Schultz, the author, makes for a political winner. The former Starbucks chief’s tough childhood and the way he fashioned an American corporate icon from a local coffee roaster makes for an inspiring tale in his new memoir “From the Ground Up.” Workers and veterans helped by the coffee chain’s generous and progressive benefits, including health insurance and college aid, are also stirring. But this message seems strangely missing from his White House ro"
Viewsroom: Brexit breakups,"Congressional Democrats have taken legal action to obtain the full Russia report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, without redactions, as well as other evidence he uncovered in his 22-month investigation but there are obstacles in their way."
Cox: Impeachment hedge runs through Saudi Arabia,"Africa is alternating between the red carpet and the red card in its approach to the mining sector. As executives of the biggest firms gathered for this week’s annual industry conference in Cape Town, the continent’s politicians were to be seen quaffing Shiraz in the shadow of Table Mountain to drum up inward investment. At least one major state is taking a different approach, though."
Barclays has new ammunition for Bramson fight,"Sony's blockbuster share splurge misses the big picture. On Friday, Japan's $55-billion electronics giant said it would repurchase 100 billion yen ($911 million) worth of stock. Days after disappointing earnings, that’s a sign of confidence from newish boss Kenichiro Yoshida. To boost longer-term returns, though, he needs to convince investors a much-needed deeper overhaul of the video games-to-movies conglomerate is also underway."
Lenovo’s reboot could run low on battery,"The so-called Green New Deal proposed by progressive U.S. Democrats is vague, flawed and controversial. It envisages sweeping measures to combat both climate change and a raft of social ills. The plan may have little political chance in the near term. But at least it’s a big idea that could provoke a needed U.S. climate-related debate."
Hadas: Profit and innovation go different ways,"Overuse and climate change are sapping the Colorado river, source of a fifth of U.S. GDP and at least $1.3 trln of market value. The feds and basin states are struggling to adapt, but investors pay little heed. Plus, can India Prime Minister Modi’s budget help him win re-election?"
Walmart is smallest loser in UK supermarket salvo,"Frédéric Oudéa needs a new name for his strategic plan, Transform to Grow. Given the Société Générale chief executive’s admission that the French bank must restructure to stand still on shareholder returns, “transform to woe” may be more appropriate. Planned cuts to SocGen’s misfiring trading hub will only go so far. A capital shortfall is a potentially bigger concern."
Brexit and costs cloud Lloyds’ sunlit uplands,"The surprise departure of Apple’s retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, leaves two questions. Why did she leave? And had she done a good job? Investors can’t know the answer to either. The $821 billion smartphone maker has a penchant for hiding information that investors would find useful. The lack of clarity helps explain the valuation discount hanging over its stock."
"Stephen Moore, Trump's pick for Fed, says he is not withdrawing",Global economic growth forecasts are drifting downward. The errors are not really surprising.
Former VP Biden's 2020 bid reshapes White House race,"Bankers in Europe have regularly complained that a steep sector selloff – the benchmark Euro STOXX Banks index is down by a third over the past 12 months – simply isn’t justified by the economic outlook. BNP Paribas, the biggest bank by assets in the euro zone, delivered a convincing rebuttal to that optimism on Wednesday with a one-tenth fall in pre-tax profit. The Parisian bank’s declining top line points to bleaker revenue outlook for the industry."
House Democrats demand documents on Trump's DHS purge,"David Malpass running the World Bank would be a fox in the henhouse. President Donald Trump is set to nominate the Treasury official and economist to lead the global lender. Malpass is skeptical of multilateralism and of closer ties to China. And some World Bank priorities, like climate change, could fade on his watch."
Everyone is right about China’s economy,"That’s the way early investor Roger McNamee describes what the social network – and Google -  is doing without proper oversight. In discussing his book, “Zucked,” he explains why just changing Facebook management won’t solve its problems and why he remains hopeful of a solution."
The Exchange: Fixing tech's gender disparity,"U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife will travel to France on June 6, where Trump will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday."
Veganism may prove a more durable diet fad,"Bob Dudley and Igor Sechin both have something the other lacks. The BP chief executive, whose $138 billion oil producer owns 20 percent of Sechin’s $67 billion Rosneft, may look covetously at the Russian group’s fat margins. Sechin, meanwhile, will look ruefully at Dudley’s much perkier valuation."
"If Chanel were a normal company, it’d be in play","Google and Facebook have made their quarterly case for a watchdog. The search engine’s parent, Alphabet, reported soaring sales and profit just days after Facebook’s blowout earnings. Concerns about fake news and the wanton commercialization of consumer data have done little to clip their dominance of online advertising. It’s all the more reason for regulatory oversight."
HSBC pushes investor goodwill to its limits,"Oil-rich Venezuela looks increasingly like a failed state. More than a tenth of the Latin American country's people have fled as its economy shrank by half over the past five years. And the cause of much of the problem, President Nicolás Maduro, remains in power even though Juan Guaidó, head of the National Assembly, recently declared himself his interim replacement – and won the backing of the United States and other Western powers."
Money can’t buy China’s chip industry much love,Brexit supporters like Jacob Rees-Mogg are both right and wrong about carmakers in Britain. The eurosceptic member of parliament correctly argues that Nissan Motor’s U-turn on production at its Sunderland plant has little to do with Britain’s impending departure from the European Union. But he’s mistaken to be blasé about the sector’s prospects if Britain crashes out of the EU without a trade deal.
UK’s centrist group is far from a Macron moment,"India’s anti-graft gains may fade with Narendra Modi. The prime minister has started to shift the consensus on corruption in his nearly five years in charge. Yet the leader once touted as certain to serve three terms faces a struggle to ensure his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party retains its grip in a general election due by May. If the strongman is weakened, bad habits could return."
Italian grudge may steer Vivendi’s big M&A mandate,"Apple is now the de facto watchdog of Silicon Valley. That’s the conclusion from its decision this week to shut down the apps on its platform that Facebook uses for internal development. The iPhone maker discovered the social-media firm was actually employing them to collect data from the public, breaching rules about enterprise-only usage. Companies have a big role to play in ensuring personal data is protected. But it’s an absurd state of affairs that regulat"
UK throws drowning Huawei a European lifeline,"Deutsche Bank is not dying, judging by its 2018 results. But nor is the lender rising from the sick bed anytime soon. Its first net profit in four years is a welcome tonic for long-suffering shareholders. Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s planned cost cuts will, however, have to be supplemented by revenue growth if the bank is to meet a meagre 4 percent return on tangible equity target this year."
Trump wall non-deal requires scraping for funds,"Online shopping baskets in India are about to get lighter. Amazon and Walmart will be limited to operating a marketplace and prevented from acting as retailers under stricter rules which came into effect on Friday, resulting in products disappearing from the virtual shelves. Their miscalculation on the direction of policy could be costly."
"Pompeo sees 'bumpy' North Korea talks, but hopes for several more chances",The California utility may face up to $30 bln in wildfire costs. But shareholders see value and lenders were willing to stump up cash. The board’s desire to cut other expenses may have driven the decision. Plus: How U.S. charges against Huawei may affect the telco industry.
"Moore, under fire from Democrats, remains Trump's Fed pick",Amazon.com’s aggression has a sustainable fuel supply. The $840 billion e-commerce giant’s holiday quarter sparkled with revenue growing 20 percent. Web services and advertising are two of the biggest sources of this expansion. They’re also the most profitable – and have plenty of juice left in the tank.
"Trump renews threat to close Mexican border, send more troops", (This April 17 story corrects the tenth paragraph to show DeVere Kutscher is no longer executive director of the Census Business Coalition.)
Ryanair CEO’s 100 mln euro bonus is within reach,"Foxconn’s embarrassing reassessment of its ambitious U.S. plans offers a lesson in basic economics. The iPhone maker and Wisconsin taxpayers made a big bet on a manufacturing revival in the United States less than two years ago. Now Terry Gou’s outfit says making flat screens there is uncompetitive, and most of the jobs will in fact be in research and design. It’s a reality check for U.S. President Donald Trump’s industrial dream."
Nigeria challenger is lesser of two outmoded evils,"Elon Musk’s 2019 is shaping up to be a matter of flourish or fold. Tesla’s chief executive presided over a $139 million fourth-quarter profit, unveiled after markets closed on Wednesday. Trouble is, it took cost cuts at the $53 billion electric-car maker to eke out even that, which was less than half the profit in the previous three months – itself Tesla’s first black ink in ages."
Spain’s snap election could harden Catalan divide,"The Federal Reserve is trying to say the same thing another way. Stocks rose following the U.S. central bank’s comments reiterating that moves on the interest rate, which it left unchanged on Wednesday, depend on economic conditions. Ditto for the pace of shrinking its balance sheet. That’s nothing new, yet overly sensitive investors needed the reminder."
Ant steps around China tech backlash into Europe,"Ultra-taxes for the ultra-rich. It’s an idea that might be catching on, to judge from the attention being paid to two related proposals from two left-wing American politicians."
"Amazon, NYC shoot selves and each other in foot","Britain’s parliament is running down the Brexit clock. Two months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union, lawmakers voted to reopen talks about the terms of its departure. The decision is unlikely to resolve the impasse. But it delays crunch decisions – and increases the risk of Britain leaving without a deal."
Viewsroom: Down Under’s upheaval,"Xinjiang is becoming an extreme example of the economic woes ailing China’s poorest provinces. Beijing says it is de-radicalising the Uighur population in the far-western region with vocational training camps. Mass detentions, however, are not helping businesses or jobs, and investment has tanked. It’s the bleeding edge of a damaging capital retreat from the country’s hinterland which has already pushed at least 23 regions to slash 2019 targets: hardly a recip"
Hadas: Four principles for regulating the internet,"Apple’s cash and services help salve iPhone worries. The $740 billion tech giant’s holiday quarter was dismal, as foretold. A 5 percent sales drop shows Tim Cook’s company can no longer expect to sell significantly more phones or jack up prices. Rising margins on extras sold to iPhone users and the promise of $130 billion of capital returns buys Apple time to refresh."
Jumbo reality check frees Airbus to fly higher,"Man Group’s decision to end its sponsorship of the Booker prize leaves the UK’s prestigious literary award without a backer. The hedge fund manager decided there were more deserving causes for its 1.6 million pound annual cheque. And having a capitalist sponsor caused occasional frictions with left-leaning literati. While its shoes won’t be easy to fill, Breakingviews columnists have drawn up a shortlist of suitable replacements."
TPG’s Asia fundraising is a sign of buyout times,"Alibaba’s co-founder and executive vice chairman joins Breakingviews to reveal what the future holds for the $400 billion tech giant. As investors fret over economic uncertainties, Tsai also tackles the recent fallout from Huawei, a bruising trade war and the case for tax cuts."
Amazon can afford to give Big Apple one more shot,China’s next phase of stimulus depends on the tax man. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar warned this week of cooler mainland demand for its diggers and trucks - a reminder that Beijing will not be building its way out of economic trouble. Monetary policy has remained cautious too. That leaves efforts to reduce the fiscal burden as the best way to get companies spending again.
Mnuchin says he cannot meet deadline to turn over Trump tax returns to House panel,"Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden plans to make a widely expected announcement of his candidacy for the presidency in a video on Wednesday, the Atlantic reported on Friday, citing sources close to Biden's top aides."
Trump opposed to aides testifying to Congress on Mueller report: Washington Post,Sweeping U.S. charges against Huawei Technologies will test appetites in Washington and Beijing for a trade deal. The Chinese telecom firm was charged with bank fraud related to Iranian sanctions violations and the theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile US. The move comes just before U.S. and Chinese officials are due to hold critical negotiations aimed at ending their tit-for-tat tariffs.
House panel to vote on holding White House ex-official in contempt,A lethal dam collapse wiped $18 billion off Brazilian miner Vale’s market capitalization. It may also derail newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro’s plans to bolster business by rolling back environmental and other regulations. Angry Brazilians and skittish lawmakers may want to go in the opposite direction.
Cannabis brings out mellow side of U.S. politics,"It’s going to be another great year in the weed business - but maybe not for U.S. President Donald Trump. Those, at least, are two conclusions to draw from informal polls of participants at Breakingviews Predictions 2019 summits in a half-dozen financial centres around the world. From New York to Paris to Hong Kong, there was unusual consensus, but with regional variations, on some of the major questions facing markets, including where to invest, the impact of a p"
The Exchange: Hollowing out white-collar jobs,"Call it the Deripaska discount. Shareholders in Rusal and En+ received the news they’d been waiting for on January 27 when the U.S. Treasury unshackled them from sanctions imposed last April by its feared Office of Foreign Assets Control. Still, the reluctance of their shares and global depository receipts (GDRs) to fully return to their pre-sanctions levels suggests lingering concern over the continuing presence of former majority shareholder Oleg Deripaska."
Chancellor: A 300-year lesson in bubble inflation,"China’s stock markets could use a more ambitious overseer. State media reported over the weekend that the head of the country’s securities regulator, Liu Shiyu, would be replaced by Yi Huiman, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s chairman. Stability often took precedence over bigger changes under Liu, an approach that achieved only mixed results."
Chinese banks resist maxing out credit cards,The robot that comes for your job might be called Poppy. Or Amelia. The former helps process insurance contracts at Lloyd’s of London. The latter handles calls from customers of Sweden’s SEB. Neither conforms to the popular image of an android waving its metallic arms. Yet both perform tasks previously done by human office workers.
Cox: Consider the merits of a Starbucks presidency,"Larry Fink undoubtedly wants to be a good capitalist and a good economic citizen. In his annual missives, the BlackRock chief executive exhorts public companies to follow his advice. BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion worth of investments, is large enough to matter to corporate managers. The 2019 letter, published last week, recommends a “commitment to a long-term approach”. Otherwise, companies cannot “effectively serve all ... stakeholders over time – not onl"
Pinduoduo's bid for calm has its limits,"The Davos elite are downbeat. The executives, financiers and political leaders who traipsed to the Swiss mountain resort this week spent much of their time fretting about slowing economies, angry citizens, and technological clashes. The gloom contrasted with the misplaced optimism of the previous year. One important factor remained unchanged, though: the supreme confidence of World Economic Forum delegates in their ability to predict what’s next."
The Exchange: Huawei’s U.S. security chief,"The China outlook from Davos is a little off-piste. Compared to the unbridled optimism of a year ago, there has been plenty of fretting at the annual World Economic Forum this week. High on the list of concerns is a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the People's Republic. For now, though, growth is cooling at a reasonable pace and Beijing has ammunition left."
Jerome Powell’s boon is Mario Draghi’s bane,"Pessimism reigns supreme at the annual gathering in the Swiss Alps thanks to trade wars, the U.S. government shutdown and rising populism. Several major leaders stayed away entirely. The event remains a networker’s dream, but self-awareness and problem-solving are sorely lacking."
India's tech rules are taking on a Chinese quality,"Democrats clamored for the speedy release of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings of his probe into whether President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Now   they finally have them, they are confronted with a choice - stay on the attack or move on."
"Review: Howard Schultz, the author, is a winner","Davos 2019 has a jaundiced hue – that is, the color of the vests worn by protesters rocking Paris every weekend. The gripes of the “gilets jaunes” should be familiar to attendees at the World Economic Forum, who have gabbed over income inequality regularly since the financial crisis. What’s different now is the specter of widespread social unrest – even violence."
Explainer: Can Democrats get hold of the full Mueller report?,"Larry Fink undoubtedly wants to be a good capitalist and a good economic citizen. In his annual missives, the BlackRock chief executive exhorts public companies to follow his advice. BlackRock, which manages $6 trillion worth of investments, is large enough to matter to corporate managers. The 2019 letter, published last week, recommends a “commitment to a long-term approach”. Otherwise, companies cannot “effectively serve all ... stakeholders over time – not onl"
U.S. lawmakers press Trump administration on Central American aid,"Carlos Ghosn is gone but the same cannot be said for tensions in the alliance between Nissan  and Renault . More than two months after his arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct, Ghosn on Wednesday night resigned as Renault chief executive and chairman, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. Successors may feed Nissan’s paranoia about political meddling."
Trump's tax law to boost incomes more in Republican states: researchers,"Big Brother startups offer white knuckle returns. China’s facial-recognition technology specialists SenseTime and Megvii are in fundraising mode. Video surveillance in China is tipped to be a $20 billion industry by 2022, according to Bernstein research, up from $8 billion in 2017. Sticky questions could result in volatile valuations, but Beijing’s resolve to watch its people closely will drive growth."
African miners get mix of red carpet and red card,"Venezuela’s inept socialist leader Nicolás Maduro is caught in a pincer movement largely of his own making. Street protesters are demanding his ouster and opposition leader Juan Guaidó has declared himself interim president. The self-inflicted wound of cratering oil output, though, is what will get him in the end."
Sony’s record share splurge misses the big picture,"Oleg Deripaska has become a political football. A pre-Christmas deal with the U.S. Treasury to lift sanctions on the Russian oligarch’s power group En+ has riled Democrats worried about the Kremlin’s influence in domestic politics. While the deal contains multiple grey areas, the overall upshot looks sufficiently black and white."
U.S. Green New Deal is at least a big idea,"A joint venture with Toyota should help recharge Panasonic’s battery business. The deal unveiled on Tuesday involves pooling resources at factories in Japan and China by the end of 2020. It represents a technological step forward for the $200 billion automaker, whilst reducing Panasonic’s dependence on Tesla."
Viewsroom: U.S. water crisis may evaporate wealth,White House hopefuls are in denial about Wall Street donors. Some Democratic presidential contenders promise to shun corporate funds. But a large war chest will be handy amid a crowded field of progressives. President Donald Trump has already raised more than $100 million for his 2020 re-election bid.
Spluttering SocGen undone by its own complacency,"Jair Bolsonaro cleared a low bar at Davos. In his first overseas appearance since taking office, Brazil’s new president on Tuesday made a brief and vague sales pitch for a ""new Brazil"". Business optimism about the country is running high, and modest changes can help deliver early wins. The longer term, however, is another matter."
Apple departure points to wider mystery,"Activist investors are bigger and busier, but face tricky currents in 2019. That was the upshot of the debates about cage-rattling shareholders at Breakingviews Predictions events this month. Investors are taking on larger and more high-profile targets – witness recent campaigns against the likes of Pernod Ricard, Barclays, and United Technologies. But big shareholders are becoming more demanding, and private equity may muscle in."
Hadas: GDP forecasters need to lower their sights,There are several aspects of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election campaign that were not previously known until the release of his report on Thursday.
Beatup BNP Paribas puts euro zone banks on notice,"UBS has sounded the end of an era on a bum note. A quarterly pre-tax loss at the lender’s investment bank coincided with the sudden departure of chief rainmaker Andrea Orcel, while market declines saw wealth management profit fall sharply. Still, as long as Chef Executive Sergio Ermotti can stick to his cost-cutting targets the group should be able to manage volatile conditions better than peers."
Trump World Bank pick would be fox in the henhouse,"Fewer Chinese babies are really an old story. The country’s birth rate fell below 11 for every 1,000 people last year, the lowest level since the People’s Republic started in 1949. It’s a reminder of how pressing it is to redesign a weak pension system."
The Exchange: How Facebook takes away our humanity,"What do Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron, Narendra Modi and Theresa May have in common? Besides leading the United States, Canada, France, India and United Kingdom, not much – except that all of them are skipping the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. Each of the leaders came to the Swiss Alps last year to deliver their takes on globalisation - or at least flog their nations as the world’s optimal destinations for capital."
"Trump will travel to France, meet with Macron in June: White House","Bold Chinese stimulus will have to wait. The country’s gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, down from 6.5 percent in the third. Growth is cooling faster than Beijing wants, but not fast enough to warrant the aggressive monetary and fiscal steps some bureaucrats, and many investors, would like to see."
Democratic presidential candidates divided over impeaching Trump,"Bold Chinese stimulus will have to wait. The country’s gross domestic product grew 6.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, down from 6.5 percent in the third. Growth is cooling faster than Beijing wants, but not fast enough to warrant the aggressive monetary and fiscal steps some bureaucrats, and many investors, would like to see."
Mexico flags U.S. border delays as harmful to both countries,Elon Musk is adding to the gloom that has enveloped much of the automotive sector in recent months. Tesla's chief executive on Friday effectively issued the firm’s first profit warning. In an email to employees he wrote that he would be reducing staff by 7 percent.
"BP beats Rosneft in valuation, not operations","Before its tainted-water scandal hit in 2014, the Michigan city was already infamous for high crime and poverty rates after a prolonged economic slump. Weaver discusses the fallout from the water crisis – and explains how the birthplace of General Motors is undergoing a revival."
Google and Facebook are begging for a watchdog,"Europe risks sacrificing its antitrust principles at the altar of global competitiveness. That’s a dangerous precedent, particularly since would-be partners Siemens and Alstom are hardly desperate for a deal."
Breakdown: How to fix Venezuela,"Fortnite is battling media titans into a corner. The smash-hit video game may have raked in as much as $2.4 billion in 2018 sales, industry tracker SuperData estimates, more than any Hollywood blockbuster last year. Netflix said this week that it is threatened too, in the fight for viewers’ attention. Success comes from the mass appeal: young and older gamers are hooked. Both traditional movie outfits and streaming giants are right to be alarmed."
Nissan’s real Brexit problems have not yet started,"John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard who died on Wednesday, defined value in more ways than one. He turned the once-heretical idea of tracking the broad stock market into the dominant form of investing. Instead of pursuing personal riches, he spread the ethos of low-cost fund management, saving investors untold billions and building the mutually owned firm into a $5 trillion juggernaut."
"India Insight: If Modi loses, graft can return","Key reaction to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-awaited report on Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, released on Thursday:"
Review: The case for regulating Facebook,"People in the Middle Kingdom are buying fewer iPhones and cars, but Nike and others are chugging away nicely. Meanwhile, India’s struggling rural farmers are a force too big to ignore in this year’s general election. Plus: The Detroit auto show reflects the industry’s gloom."
Deutsche Bank reprieve is only temporary,"Frédéric Oudéa remains at the mercy of his misfiring traders. The Société Générale boss on Thursday warned the French lender’s investment banking revenue had fallen by a fifth in the fourth quarter. Keeping the dividend flat and letting investors take it in shares, rather than cash, points to further capital headwinds."
Amazon and Walmart get caught in India’s web,"Narendra Modi faces an airborne dilemma. To keep Jet Airways flying, the Indian prime minister may have to choose between relaxing foreign ownership rules for Abu Dhabi backer Etihad, and letting state lenders take a hit on a private carrier. Both options touch the country’s financial sore points – and represent a quandary for the ruling party ahead of an election due by May. "
Viewsroom: Why did PG&E file for bankruptcy?,"What’s the cost of the U.S. shutdown for businesses? Delta Air Lines has taken a guess: $25 million of revenue for every month the government stays closed. Big deal. Like the market plunge that hit bank earnings in the last financial quarter, the shutdown has high visibility but little lasting impact. Investors are focused on risks that are bigger and harder to visualize."
Amazon’s aggression has sustainable fuel supply,"Financial markets are showing Theresa May that there is a way out of her Brexit impasse. The pound rose and stocks were stable after the prime minister’s historic parliamentary defeat on Tuesday evening, defying earlier predictions by politicians of a crash. If May survives, a softer Brexit or second referendum have become more likely. Investors’ relative calm contrasts with the political confusion."
Companies warn Trump: Census citizenship question could be costly,"Miners are in position to close the confidence gap in 2019. One important indicator suggests equity investors are fretting about a Chinese slowdown and don't trust cashed-up bosses at BHP, Rio Tinto and elsewhere to stay restrained. The pessimism is overdone."
Top Democrats leave open option of Trump impeachment after Mueller report,"Nearly a decade ago, former Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes derisively called Netflix the “Albanian army,” implying the video-streaming service would never take over the world. “The mouse that roared” is more like it."
Vulnerable House Democrats tread carefully in wake of Mueller report,Theresa May’s looming Brexit defeat will begin a process of elimination. Britain’s parliament is on Tuesday expected to reject the prime minister’s plan to leave the European Union. The historic vote will offer few pointers about which alternatives politicians prefer. But it will at least force them to test – and discard – some of their rapidly shrinking options.
Foxconn’s U.S. debacle offers an economics lesson,"Trade with China gets the attention these days, but shrinking business investments into and out of the country present a longer-term concern. Inbound funds from overseas grew less than 1 percent in yuan terms last year, to $131 billion. Flows to North America and Europe tanked. Weaker demand is a problem, but deepening suspicions are as much to blame."
Tesla’s 2019 becoming a matter of flourish or fold,"Citigroup boss Mike Corbat is doing well enough at making his $138 billion bank more efficient. He has a year to do better. Last week he let investor ValueAct inside the tent, with an agreement to give the activist fund access to confidential information for a year. That will increase the pressure to catch up with rivals."
Fed patiently tells market it will be patient,U.S. Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday that most of the redactions made to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report ahead of its release were made to prevent harm to ongoing legal matters.
Hadas: An ultra-tax on the ultra-rich makes sense,"New Look is leading a hot trend on Britain’s high street: hefty debt restructurings. The ailing retailer is writing off three-quarters of its debt in an effort to repair its finances. Like rival Debenhams, it can only survive if stores enjoy a revival. But after a bleak Christmas and with Brexit looming, a rosy future looks far from certain."
British parliament opts to run down Brexit clock ,"Anheuser-Busch InBev executives who hope for a $70 billion valuation for their Asia business deserve to have their breath tested. The Belgian brewer is considering an initial public offering of part of the unit, Reuters reported on Friday. The region is a fast-growing jewel in AB InBev’s crown, but it faces stiff competition in China, and has struggled in India and Southeast Asia. That makes the mooted price tag tough to swallow."
Xinjiang is an extreme case of China's growth woes,"Wall Street’s top watchdog has a bad case of denial – about denials. As a condition of settling cases, the Securities and Exchange Commission typically bars alleged wrongdoers from later claiming they’re innocent. This so-called gag rule arguably violates free-speech rights, though. If a new lawsuit challenging it succeeds, the regulator may finally have to start – gasp! – proving its accusations."
Apple cash and services salve iPhone worries,"Bruce Linton runs the world's biggest cannabis producer, Canopy Growth. He visited Breakingviews to discuss what's coming down the pipe in 2019, why a $100 bln weed company is still some way off, and why he doesn't actually partake - yet."
Thruppence: Who wins by sponsoring UK book prize?,"Japanese cold feet are about to land Britain’s energy policy in hot water. Hitachi could next week halt its involvement in the Wylfa nuclear power project in Wales, Nikkei reported on Jan. 11. For a UK government that wants reactors to increase their share of domestic power generation from around a quarter to a third by 2035, that’s a sizeable headache."
The Exchange: Joseph Tsai,Xiaomi’s big vision just got a market reckoning. A grim outlook for Chinese smartphone demand has walloped entrepreneur Lei Jun's $33 billion company. The stock selloff suggests investors aren’t ready to buy into the internet services hype.  
China’s next stimulus plan looks to the tax man,Investors aren’t giving U.S. retailers an inch. Macy's shares fell by nearly a fifth on Thursday after weak December sales prompted it to cut forecasts. Target and Kohl's also felt the downdraft despite more upbeat numbers. Online disruption and the decline of old stalwarts Sears and J.C. Penney have made investors justifiably jittery.
Biden to announce U.S. presidential run on Wednesday: report,Investors aren’t giving U.S. retailers an inch. Macy's shares fell by nearly a fifth on Thursday after weak December sales prompted it to cut forecasts. Target and Kohl's also felt the downdraft despite more upbeat numbers. Online disruption and the decline of old stalwarts Sears and J.C. Penney have made investors justifiably jittery.
Supreme Court girds for fight over Trump census citizenship question,"Rising rates, lower oil prices, wobbly markets and the backlash against Saudi Arabia could put Masa Son’s $97 bln fund on the spot this year. Elsewhere, some Indian tech startups may take the world by storm. Plus, Breakingviews picks three indicators to monitor the world economy."
House Judiciary Committee issues subpoena for full Mueller report,"Tesco had a good holiday. Britain’s biggest grocer sold more than rivals over a difficult Christmas period, doing better across the gamut of food, clothing and general homeware. The company is also managing to launch cheaper offerings to fight off discounters like Lidl without jeopardising its operating margin targets. Its successes merit a higher valuation."
U.S. Huawei charges test trade deal appetite,"Stephen Miller, the White House aide driving a hardline immigration stance, was invited on Wednesday to testify to a House committee about the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border."
Vale disaster threatens Brazil’s deregulation push,"Temasek is helping a drugstore giant flaunt its glow. The Singapore state investor may sell some of its 25-percent stake in health and beauty heavyweight A.S. Watson, Reuters says. The retailer's size, moves upmarket in the mainland, and growth elsewhere in Asia could justify a premium to rivals."
Cox: Cannabis and impeachment on readers’ minds,"Donald Trump could open a Pandora’s box if he invokes special crisis powers. The U.S. president is considering bypassing Congress to build a border wall by declaring a national emergency. In theory, similar authority could enable him to shut down CNN, say, or block access to Facebook."
Deripaska markdown will persist at En+ and Rusal,"Anyone who believes that prices should be fair would agree that Celgene needs a corporate shake-up – just not the one the U.S. pharmaceutical company is about to get. From that perspective, the proposed $74 billion shares-and-cash takeover by Bristol-Myers Squibb announced last week looks like a reward for unjust behaviour."
Chinese markets may wait longer for bold changes,"A haphazard selloff at HNA Group keeps getting trickier. The Chinese conglomerate is pushing ahead with the flogging of stakes in an online lender, life insurer and brokerage. Few signs of a clear strategy and market perceptions of creditor clout will make it harder to profitably unwind HNA’s $50 billion buying spree. Falling asset prices aren’t helping, either."
Review: The hollowing out of white-collar work,The U.S. government shutdown is a bad omen for a bigger fiscal battle ahead. The economic impact of the partial federal closure sparked by President Donald Trump’s insistence on securing funding for a wall along the Mexico border will probably be minimal. The real danger comes if the dispute infects discussions about the U.S. debt ceiling.
Hadas: Larry Fink can’t reshape capitalism,"Cracks are showing in the $97 billion Vision Fund. That undermines the idea of SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son as a tech sage, and makes life harder for his dealmakers."
Downbeat Davos is still short on introspection,"Samsung Electronics' bad news intensifies its $70-billion bind. The South Korean giant says its fourth-quarter operating profit will tumble 29 percent compared to a year earlier, to a worse-than-expected 10.8 trillion won ($9.7 billion). With chip prices set to fall further, there is comfort to be found in the group’s ballooning cash pile. Scion and de facto boss Jay Y. Lee can boost investor returns and invest more energetically in new tech, from 5G to autono"
China outlook from Davos goes a little off-piste,"The World Bank could be a new stick for Donald Trump to beat China with. Jim Yong Kim has quit as head of the global lender, and the White House has a big say on his replacement. American officials had already pressured the bank to lend less to China and warned about Beijing’s influence. This gives them a chance to instal a hawkish new boss, and open up a new front in the trade war."
Viewsroom: Global elite-lite takes Davos downer,"France’s new squeeze-out plans may tempt luxury magnate Bernard Arnault to make a final swoop on taking his Christian Dior holding private. President Emmanuel Macron’s wide-ranging bill to make la Republique more attractive for business, known as “loi Pacte”, envisages cutting to 90 percent the bar for companies wanting to buy out listed minorities. The rule changes, combined with falling luxury stocks prices, may revive the magnate’s interest in taking Dior behin"
Mueller report leaves Democrats in a quandary,"Farmers hold the key to Narendra Modi’s second term. To stand a chance of winning a general election to be held by May, India’s prime minister is under pressure to appease those left desperate by crashing crop prices. Two-thirds of the country’s 1.3 billion people live in the countryside, and almost half of the workforce depends on agriculture. Their anger is one reason the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was bruised in recent state polls. New Delhi may need to act"
How Mueller's decision on obstruction helped save Trump,"The Trump administration is lifting a long-standing ban against U.S. citizens filing lawsuits against foreign companies that use properties seized by Cuba’s Communist government since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday."
"Mueller finds no conspiracy, but extensive Trump-Russia contacts",Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have been inseparable since he launched the social network 15 years ago. But his lack of perspective helped create the existential problems facing the company today. His priority is finding a new leader who can take over and meet the challenge.
"The ""gilets jaunes"" invade Davos if only in spirit","Oligopolies are omnipresent, dynamism is dwindling and wage growth is miserable. Popular faith in capitalism is tarnished as a result, as France's ""gilets jaunes"" protests and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump demonstrate. Two new polemics, Tim Wu's ""The Curse of Bigness"" and ""The Myth of Capitalism,"" by Jonathan Tepper with Denise Hearn, argue that the problem stems in part from a lack of competition. Both focus on a U.S. antitrust revival as a solu"
Hadas: Larry Fink can’t reshape capitalism,"Ropey bets on the price of oil will drive European airline M&A in 2019. The price of a barrel of crude is unusually volatile heading into the New Year. The majority of airlines are heavily hedged against sky-high values, but it’s equally possible Brent will bottom out far below its 2018 peaks. How things pan out will dictate how many weaker outfits get taken out.     The cost of refuelling is crippling Europe’s airlines. Over the past three years, the cost of a b"
Ghosn successors may further strain Nissan ties,"Karsten Dybvad is putting on a brave face. Danske Bank’s new chairman recently insisted that the Copenhagen-based lender did not face an “existential crisis”, despite helping clients launder up to 200 billion euros between 2007 and 2015 via a Baltic subsidiary. In 2019 that will be put to the test.    Over the past year U.S. lawmakers have ramped up regulatory pressure on foreign lenders that fall foul of anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines and sanctions viola"
Big Brother startups offer white knuckle returns,"Leveraged buyout lenders are in the firing line in 2019. With central banks raising rates and shrinking balance sheets, the happy times for the likes of Blackstone, KKR and Apollo Global Management will subside. But buyout barons will be laughing compared to those who financed their deals.     Low rates and the hunt for yield in recent years triggered a boom in risky lending. The volume of leveraged loans in particular reached $1.3 trillion in the United States a"
Venezuela’s Maduro caught in pincer movement,"Bristol-Myers Squibb is taking a $74 billion bet against the market. There are good reasons to buy rival oncology giant Celgene. But cost cuts don’t cover the 54 percent premium, and the target’s owners get the financial benefit. Bristol is hoping for luck in the courts and multiple regulatory approvals that Celgene’s shareholders were skeptical of."
Oleg Deripaska’s En+ deal is more sour than sweet,"Big economies are throwing up tariffs, but East Africa’s common market could swell to 250 mln people if Ethiopia joins the club.

Toyota JV recharges Panasonic’s battery business,"America’s cannabis growers will follow an unusual path to propriety. The subversive industry is feared by the establishment, with investors reliant on legal loopholes. Yet these companies are starting out much like China’s tech giants did. In the same fashion, as they create jobs and wealth, appetite for reining them in will wane."
White House hopefuls in denial on Wall St donors,"Initial public offerings by Lyft and Uber Technologies will drain Tesla’s scarcity value in the next 12 months. Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker, whose market value hit $64.8 billion in August 2018, has, to date, been virtually the only way to invest directly in the car industry of the future. But the two ride-hailing firms will give U.S. public shareholders who factor in environmental, social and governance concerns new options."
Brazil’s Bolsonaro clears low Davos bar,"Next shows how the sickly UK retail sector has lots of losers, but few real winners. The high street chain reported better-than-expected Christmas sales, helped by its larger online presence.

Factbox: New revelations from the Mueller report,"Mario Draghi’s successor may not be the most important appointment at the European Central Bank in the year ahead. Most of those in the running to replace the Italian as president lack his creativity in tackling existential problems, such as a breakup of the euro. Others will have more scope to sway the debate. Ireland’s Philip Lane, who is in pole position to take over as chief economist from Peter Praet, is the sort of freethinker who would have outsized influe"
House Democrat Nadler sees evidence of obstruction in Mueller report,"The Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Shanghai stands as a hulking symbol of the company’s Chinese ambitions. The 30,000-square-foot caffeinated wonderland represents just one of 6,000, mostly smaller stores the chain plans to roll out across the mainland by 2022. Such bold plans will run up against stiffer competition and trade-war-related pressures in 2019. Local backers will help preserve this fledgling Bean Dynasty."
Top Democrats say Mueller report undercuts Barr claims on Trump obstruction,"An active acquirer lurks in South Korea. Over the last couple of years, companies from Japan and China have led Asia in overseas deals. Seoul-based conglomerate SK Group could be up next. Bankers should make sure they have boss Chey Tae-won on speed dial."
Cost cuts can help UBS ride market ructions,"Apple's warning about slowing Chinese sales eroded more than $50 billion of its $750 billion market capitalization on Wednesday afternoon. It will also have taken a chunk out of confidence in the global economy. Investors don’t always believe China’s official economic data, but they can’t brush aside news that iPhone sales in the country have rapidly decelerated, even if Apple is possibly at the sharp end of the slowdown."

Cox: Davos becomes a liability in the populist era,"If 2019 is like 2018, roughly 30,000 Americans will be killed by a bullet. And more big companies and investors will say publicly it’s time to make guns safer. If they say it in the right way, it might even make a difference."

Musk’s rare dose of realism could serve Tesla well,Simple economics teaches that the most efficient way to reduce demand for something is to increase its price. That is the principle behind taxes on carbon dioxide emissions. Slightly more sophisticated and realistic economics teaches another lesson.
The Exchange: Flint Mayor Karen Weaver,"U.S. President Donald Trump has a knack for claiming credit for others’ achievements. In 2019, his use of trade tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing will look like it’s working. But technologies such as factory automation are going to be the real reason global companies will manufacture more products locally.    Trump’s tariffs on China and other trade partners like Europe are a headache for companies that ship goods between the world’s three major economic bl"

Fortnite outplays media titans in a battle royale,"Remo Ruffini could be Italy’s answer to Bernard Arnault in 2019. Since rescuing Moncler in 2003, the entrepreneur has rejuvenated the brand into a goose-down success story. There’s a long way to go before he can use the growing strength of 7.5 billion euro Moncler to create anything like Arnault’s LVMH, worth 130 billion euros. But if he fancies building the first Italian luxury aggregator, now is a good time.    Italian luxury is fragmented and valuations "
Jack Bogle defined value in more ways than one,European Union rebels will lay siege to Brussels in 2019. Voters across the bloc will go to the polls in May to choose a new European Parliament.

Instant View: Reaction to Mueller's report on Russia's role in 2016 U.S. election,"In Mel Brooks’ seminal 1977 Hitchcock parody “High Anxiety”, much of the action revolves around the Psycho-Neurotic Institute for the Very, Very Nervous.

Mueller report does not conclude Trump committed crime but does not exonerate him,"Southeast Asia’s apps-for-everything will dominate in 2019. Cash is being lavished on Grab and Go-Jek, as they dabble in everything from ride-hailing to groceries. It’s a Chinese approach to luring and keeping consumers who are moving online fast. "
Report says Trump foresaw end of presidency when told of special counsel investigation: report,"After all the hype, blockchain is due for a breakthrough in 2019. Banks and companies are gradually applying versions of the distributed-ledger technology associated with bitcoin to tasks like settlement. Demonstrating blockchain’s utility, though, will say little about the value of cryptocurrencies themselves."
Viewsroom: China’s slowdown is not created equal,U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America first” mantra involves barriers to trade and immigration and a sort of manufacturing nationalism. Experiences like Argentina’s show that this approach creates market dysfunction and can hit economic output and jobs. More of that kind of fallout is likely in 2019 as the White House rolls out further protectionist measures.
SocGen warning boosts investment bank sceptics,"Character weaknesses are usually evident by the time people hit their twenties and become hard to fix by their thirties. The euro celebrates its twentieth birthday saddled with flaws dating back to its conception.

Markets point to way out of Brexit impasse,"Larry Ellison is anything but a check on Elon Musk. The Oracle founder calls himself a “very close friend” of the Tesla CEO and owns nearly $1 billion of the automaker’s stock. He also shares an imperious style and penchant for outsized pay. Musk’s deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission mandated an independent director, but Ellison is unlikely to rein him in."

Netflix reaps the dividends of its dominance,"Energy-sector reform is up in the air in both Brazil and Mexico. In the coming year, new regimes in Latin America’s two biggest economies will wrestle with balancing 1970s-style nationalism against the need to open up to foreign and private capital to exploit their oil and gas resources.

Brexit defeat will begin process of elimination,"Boardroom disputes will look like child’s play compared to the hurly-burly of American politics. Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, hedge-fund boss Tom Steyer, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and Michael Bloomberg are businessmen deciding next year if they’ll make a White House run.

Citigroup is in a good place to do better,"Europe’s careworn investment banks have something new to worry about in 2019: a close-up examination by regulators. As five years of benign credit and abundant liquidity comes to an end, watchdogs are probing lenders’ internal models to test their resilience to turbulent markets. For banks which hitherto relied on their own guesstimates, that could eat into capital.    The Single Supervisory Mechanism – the European Central Bank’s top bank cop - has spent much of"
Barr says redactions to Mueller report were not made due to executive privilege,"ByteDance would add some oomph to China’s BAT. The fast-growing creator of news and video apps is already privately valued at $75 billion, putting it on par with web search outfit Baidu, whose public equity in early December was worth some $65 billion. A 2019 merger between the two will modify the constituent parts of the acronym shared with Alibaba and Tencent."

Barr says Mueller did not uncover evidence Trump obstructed Russia probe,"Small countries will lose the most from a U.S. fight over the World Trade Organization. The global trade body’s appeals panel may be paralyzed next year because of U.S. obstinacy. Yet America, China and the EU can wring concessions without filing complaints over commerce disputes. Minnows like Panama and Moldova lack other recourse."
New Look makeover is bad trend for UK high street,"Stock and bond pickers have been losing ground for years to low-cost funds that simply track indexes like the S&P 500 or factors such as low volatility. Now they face a new threat: robots. In 2019, logic favors a bigger role for the machines."

Xiaomi's grand plan gets market reckoning,"Whisper it gently: Deutsche Bank shareholders might finally have something to cheer about. The German lender has in recent years seen seemingly irreversible declines in trading revenue that have outpaced cost-cuts. In 2019 its business mix, and the potential for currency volatility and rising European rates, should make it a relative winner.    Ever since the financial crisis Europe’s investment banks have resembled a car crash in slow motion. The region’s lender"
Investors stop giving U.S. retailers an inch,The global $1 billion competitive video-game market will reach a new level in 2019. Viewership for e-sports tournaments already surpasses that of the Major League Baseball in the United States.

Viewsroom: High anxiety hits SoftBank’s vision,"Can Sino-American trade disputes be settled on the mat? Don’t expect Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to don tights for a Presidential SmackDown.

Trump aide Stephen Miller asked to testify on immigration to House panel,"The ghosts of Argentina’s past will come for President Mauricio Macri in next October's elections. The pro-business president has had to seek IMF help as he tries to steer Latin America’s No. 3 economy to health. That’s a gift to his discredited Peronist opponents. Recovery from drought and currency collapse is likely in 2019, but may come too late to prevent the return of the spendthrifts of yore."

Hadas: Big mergers show capitalism’s bad side,"What’s the biggest threat to global markets in the coming year? It’s not a rise in U.S. interest rates, or the end of the European Central Bank’s bond buying. Rather, it’s the Bank of Japan. Even small adjustments by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to ultra-loose monetary policy could agitate global asset prices more than other, widely expected changes."
HNA’s haphazard selloff keeps getting trickier,"Two behemoth retailers are beginning to morph.

Since taking the reins in April, the Sony boss has boosted earnings at Japan's $61 billion movies-to-video-games group.

Any reluctance to move quickly will see hedge funds make a cameo in Sony's remake.    Yoshida’s predecessor sold the laptops business, sl"
French squeeze-out plans may tempt Arnault on Dior,"The latest U.S. cyber allegations risk a bigger rift with China.

Kushner urges 'open mind' on upcoming Mideast plan: source,"Card players can bluff by raising the stakes to induce their opponents to fold.

Review: Saving capitalism from itself,"Rio Tinto will be first on the spending trail.

Expect that to change in 2019."
Hapless oil bets will drive airline M&A,"China’s great pipe spin-off will get underway in 2019.

Bristol-Myers takes $74 bln bet against the market,"Disappointment is coming for the clients of private equity firms. Companies which use debt and management wiles to take businesses private typically target an annual yield – the so-called internal rate of return – of at least 15 percent. It’s hard to see recent deals matching that. Instead of 15, investors should steel themselves for more like five."

Ilhan Omar's supporters rally outside Trump event in Minnesota,"David Solomon is like the owner of a Ferrari who hasn’t been given the keys.

Ex-Massachusetts governor challenges Trump in 2020 Republican presidential race,"China's Didi Chuxing will seize the wheel of a carmaker in 2019. Similar to global peers, the $56 billion ride-hailing unicorn has tied up with traditional manufacturers. Falling valuations in China's car sector will inspire boss Cheng Wei to buy a brand."
Next ECB boss will matter less than his sidekick,"The UK’s root and branch review into audit firms leaves unfinished business. Britain wants smaller book-keepers to have a bigger share of the market, and stricter Chinese walls between consulting and auditing. The reforms should help competition, but they may not do much to make audits much more reliable, or avoid crises like Carillion."
Starbucks will start brewing a venti Chinese deal,"The cult of Xi Jinping is due to weaken alongside China’s $12 trillion economy. His muddled policies will keep growth slouching toward 6 percent. That could embolden a long-subdued reform faction to push back. Investors would get more defaults, fewer crackdowns on tech titans, and faster market opening."
Keep an eye on Seoul for Asia’s next big buyer,"Indian unicorns will feast on richer pastures in 2019. Restaurant search firm Zomato, ride-hailing firm Ola and hotel-rooms aggregator Oyo are leading the charge overseas by the country’s largest tech companies. A complex home market, a big diaspora and deep-pocketed backers will ensure success rarely achieved by Asian startups in far-flung lands."
Apple sales warning is a Chinese joint venture,"If Facebook can negotiate a difficult year ahead, it may be on its way to becoming Silicon Valley’s version of JPMorgan. A decade ago, financial firms were taking a whipping from politicians, just as tech companies are today. As Jamie Dimon’s bank shows, those who survive the process can end up even stronger."
"A century on, bet on a new Black Sox-like scandal","Canada’s biggest economic threat is sitting across the border. Even though the country managed to salvage a trade deal with its southern neighbor and Mexico in 2018, aggressive economic policies have turned the United States into Canada’s own vampire squid. Forecast GDP growth of 2 percent in 2019 is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s to lose."
Firearms will test the mettle of woke financiers,"To create the hedge fund manager character Barry Cohen – the protagonist in his latest novel “Lake Success” – Shteyngart spent lots of time with real-life financiers, from quants to activists.

Three key indicators to watch like a hawk in 2019,"Johnson & Johnson's  talc crisis will linger for years. Investors erased $40 billion of its market value on Friday, after Reuters revealed the U.S. healthcare giant knew for decades its baby powder was sometimes tainted by asbestos.

Tech to disrupt supply chains more than trade wars,"China’s “social credit” system is another worry for executives, as tensions spike over the arrest of a Huawei executive at U.S. behest. The government's plan to blacklist people and companies for misbehaviour is widely misunderstood. But its implications for business should raise eyebrows. By holding executives accountable for their company's misdeeds, it blurs the already fuzzy Chinese line between corporate and personal interests."
Factbox: Five things to look for in Mueller's Trump-Russia report,"The world is ever more connected via the internet, from cars and power grids to home appliances and toys.

In some ways, the attack of the killer fridges has already begun."
Trump wishes 'no ill will' with tweet on Muslim lawmaker: White House,"Even by his own standards, Donald Trump has been contradictory on oil. The U.S. president spent much of 2018 berating the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for keeping crude prices high by undersupplying the market. At the same time, he exacerbated the problem by reinstating export sanctions on Iran. An early December cut by OPEC and fellow producers including Russia is an irritant, but relatively low prices still look attainable."
Trump's re-election campaign raised more than $30 million in first-quarter of 2019,"President Macron hopes a 10 bln euro splurge from state coffers will mollify rioters calling him the “president of the rich.” But it’ll worsen the country’s deficit, risking an EU rebuke. It may, though, offer cover for Italy, whose debt load is causing friction with Brussels."
Italy’s woes could spell LVMH moment for Moncler,"Spooked by hostile markets, Rome’s anti-austerity government is offering to trim its 2019 budget deficit goal by 0.4 percent of GDP. The U-turn may help Italy escape damaging European Union fines. Investors will be pleased, but the government may just be saving its battle for another day."
EU rebels will lay siege to Brussels,China’s latest decisions could be handing U.S. President Donald Trump more ammunition in the trade war. Canadian officials say they have lost contact with one of their citizens after Beijing detained one of the country’s ex-diplomats. It will make a lasting economic peace harder.

The outcome will help clarify Britain’s Brexit endgames."
A made-in-America market will be a distorted one,"It’s getting increasingly crowded at the bar for shareholder activists in Europe, but it’s still possible to get a good drink. Elliott Advisors, the U.S. hedge fund manager, has found another decent tipple in the form of Pernod Ricard, the French purveyor of booze like Absolut vodka and Chivas Regal whisky. "
Euro faces tough adulescence,"Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has approved a request to identify places to potentially house up to 5,000 unaccompanied migrant children, the Pentagon said on Wednesday."
A plucky local upstart will take on Macau’s moguls,"France knows a thing or two about meddling investors. The government regularly sticks its nose in private industry’s affairs. Moguls like Vincent Bolloré have long thrown their weight around public boardrooms at home and abroad. But few large French companies have undergone the cage rattling that regularly rocks their American cousins. Pernod Ricard, the booze group, got a taste of that when Elliott Advisors turned up with a 2.5 percent stake on Wednesday. More is"
A plucky local upstart will take on Macau’s moguls,"American executives who prayed for a trade war truce are a disappointed lot. Following the arrest of China telco Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada, they’ve been sent to the front lines."
Larry Ellison is anything but a check on Elon Musk,"A grilling of Google chief Sundar Pichai revealed that Congress is still searching for a clue. The U.S. lawmakers he faced on Tuesday failed to land a blow, and seemed ill informed about what the search engine, owned by the $730 billion Alphabet, actually does. The knowledge gap is risky for tech firms because it increases the risk of regulation that misses the mark."
Criticism mounts of Trump pick for U.S. Federal Reserve,"If the big U.S. tech firms want more friends in Washington, they could try looking in flyover country. Facebook, Google and others have built businesses that mostly aid the richer, coastal parts of America. It’s in the interior that they can do particular good, by creating more jobs. That would be a slow but long-lasting way to build support."
Trump weighs sending 'unlimited supply' of immigrants to sanctuary cities,"After four successive Saturday protests that saw sustained rioting in the streets of Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron learned a lesson that crushed the hopes of his recent predecessors: it is no easier to govern than to reform. That revelation has come very late for the youthful former banker, who believed he’d been given a clearer mandate to do more than simply avoid conflict or hustle France through another few years of listlessness. "
Trump asylum policy gets temporary reprieve from Court of Appeals,"Are global equities cheap yet? After two sharp corrections in February and October 2018, investors will be running their rules over stock-market valuations. They should be wary of falling victim to a value trap."
Brazil will get energy mostly right; Mexico won’t,"It is hard not to see tense U.S.-China situations these days though a trade-war prism. Such is the case with a Fuzhou court banning the sale of some Apple iPhone models just days after the arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer in Canada. The timing of U.S. regulators reviving concerns about audits seems curious, too. Even without direct links to increasingly frayed relations between Beijing and Washington, the last few days serve as a reminder of the tech"
Boardroom brawls will be child’s play to politics,"Uber and Lyft are jockeying for pole position to get through the window for initial public offerings while it’s open. The ride-hailing companies have made confidential filings for deals that could value the former at up to $120 billion and the later at more than $15 billion. Yet the frightful experience of Moderna, which plunged nearly 20 percent in its first day of trading last week after the biggest float ever in the biotech sector, shows demand for cash-burn"
China will outdo U.S. in scramble for Africa,"It’s hard to imagine a company embodying as many of the challenges and opportunities of 21st century capitalism as Siemens. The German conglomerate’s CEO swings by Times Square to discuss trade, breakups, power, automation, labor, Saudi Arabia and lots in between with Rob Cox. "
EU investment banks face the regulatory microscope,Britain is trapped in a Brexit maze of its own making. Almost two-and-a-half years after the country voted to leave the European Union - and with just 109 days to go until its 45-year membership is due to expire - politicians are still arguing about the best escape route. A crucial vote on Theresa May’s favoured exit plan looks destined to end in defeat for the prime minister. The United Kingdom then confronts a baffling range of political options. Despite the co
ByteDance will take over B in China’s BAT,The White House said on Tuesday it would appeal a court ruling  that halted a Trump administration policy requiring some asylum seekers to return to Mexico and wait for their legal cases to proceed.
Expect a Macquarie 50th anniversary deal,"Distasteful disclosure practices are spoiling some Chinese food delivery. Meituan Dianping, operator of the country’s biggest food delivery app, fired one employee and referred others to police after an internal corruption probe. It only reported the news in Chinese, and didn't flag it before its initial public offering. Once-reported metrics have also gone missing. Such opacity is unappetising."
Small nations will lose most from U.S. WTO fight,"In 1997, Pierre Bourdieu argued that the “precariousness” of modern work was a big problem. The French intellectual claimed that the decline of secure jobs and clear career paths led to “the destruction of existence … to the degradation of every relationship with the world, time, and space”. Everyone, he said, was affected, because no one could escape the fear of being rendered precarious."
Welcome the new AI investment overlords,"A global anti-Huawei push risks making an already concentrated market even less competitive. The drive is defensible on security grounds, but could lead to higher mobile bills, less investment and more widespread outages like the one caused on Thursday by Swedish group Ericsson’s glitchy software."
The Exchange: How corporate competition died,"A trade truce gives China room to loosen up. Beijing has left its benchmark interest rate untouched since 2015. But officials at the People’s Bank of China, eager to foster growth, have other monetary policy levers they can pull, like interbank rates or the amount lenders must hold in reserve. A period of diplomatic calm gives them the space to do just that."
"Weed, China, guns and money lead most-read stories","Mike Bloomberg said on Tuesday that he has “a lot of experience” that would be useful if he were president of the United States. Appearing in Iowa, the U.S. state that kicks off the quadrennial primary season, he added that he’d try to sell his financial-data empire if he wins the 2020 presidential race. Lucky for him, money is plentiful for a buyout that could be valued at $40 billion. And there’s a recent deal that could provide a blueprint: the sale of Refin"
"Mexican labor bill nabs key Congress vote, spurred by Pelosi warning",U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping agreed to a cooling-off period in an escalating tariff spat. Will the ceasefire yield results or is it a stalling tactic? The markets are spooked. Breakingviews columnists discuss the issue from both sides of the Pacific.
"Trump, in talks with South Korea's Moon, says sanctions on North Korea to stay in place","As rolling power blackouts hit South Africa this week, an old gag resurfaced. “What did South Africans use for lighting before candles?” Answer: “Electricity.” The problems at state-owned Eskom are no laughing matter, though. Energy rationing is not even the most serious issue: the utility is broke and its debt pile is too much for the government to handle."
SoftBank picking its battles with U.S. national security committee,"Huawei has now firmly settled into the eye of a geopolitical storm. Canadian officials arrested Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom equipment maker’s chief financial officer, for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions. The case arises just as more countries put the squeeze on Huawei. Suppliers will be rattled, too. It may be a microcosm of a broader containment effort."
Investors will swap City offices for Euro sheds,"What’s the value of having friends? For AT&T, the answer seems to be about $100 million. That’s how much the telecoms group may charge streaming service Netflix to show the hit TV show of that name for another year. Given AT&T’s plans to launch its own video service, depriving a rival of a blockbuster might have been smarter."
Deutsche Bank will be unlikely 2019 trading star,"As world leaders meet in Poland to beef up the Paris accords, Cornerstone Capital’s founder explains why the economics of battling global warming trump naysaying politicians. She also lays out how to spot green washing and says investors who ignore ESG factors should go to jail."
Tencent will become world e-sports champion,"U.S. President Donald Trump praised his Egyptian counterpart,  Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, as a ""great president"" on Tuesday, even as a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers raised concerns about Sisi's record on human rights, efforts to keep him in office for many years and planned Russian arms purchases."
Asia’s tech titans face Nissan-style key-man risk,"Markets can be a costly business. Ronald Coase won a Nobel prize in economics in 1991 for pointing that out. He said that companies are created to save on transaction costs, and according to one interpretation, the savings are often large enough to justify pulling together quite diverse businesses. Problems at General Electric and the break-up of United Technologies show why that analysis is only partly right."
A Trump versus Xi wrestling match might just help,"Beijing is hanging a blade over the country's technology titans. The arrest of a senior Alibaba executive, the head of its video-streaming unit, suggests China's anti-graft crackdown will not spare its web titans. Companies’ poor disclosure, though, is adding to the problem."
Overleveraged AT&T is a magnet for activists,"The U.S. bond market’s flashing light has turned from green to red. Treasury yields plunged to a three-month low on Tuesday and gave out a potential recession signal. While low rates have supported the economy and stock market during the recovery, the latest moves suggest troubling weakness."
Ghosts of Argentine past will come for Macri's job,"Soon after relocating to Paris I met an entrepreneur with an extraordinary ambition to challenge the technological dominance of Microsoft and Google by creating an alternative digital operating system. I also encountered an angry protester in a yellow vest, or “gilet jaune”, who wanted to overthrow the government. Welcome to the two faces of the global centre of the resistance."

Financing drought cracks farmers' loyalty to Trump,"Tencent Music Entertainment will strain to hit Spotify's high notes. China's social media and gaming titan is floating its music-streaming arm at a valuation of up to $24.5 billion. Sales are up, and the unit has a novel, profitable business model. Still, the company's huge premium to Spotify is hard to justify."
World will improve where it matters most in 2019,"The euro zone’s latest reform drive leaves its crisis fault lines intact. After all-night talks, the single currency’s finance ministers on Tuesday morning agreed to make sovereign bailouts smoother and share the cost of winding down banks. Yet deep opposition to sharing debt burdens means the region remains ill-prepared for economic shocks."
Dozens of asylum seekers returned to Mexico under Trump policy gain entry to U.S.,"Big ambitions require investment, but not all infusions of capital are equal. Cronos, the Canadian pot producer, is in early talks with Marlboro maker Altria, Reuters reported on Monday. An association with a huge tobacco company isn’t exactly what this nascent industry needs."
Nomination for top U.S. diplomat for South Asia withdrawn: White House,"The United States and China are already speaking different languages about trade. Their respective tariff-ceasefire spin over the weekend reflects different interpretations and priorities. Whether on auto import duties or the welcome Chinese students receive in America, negotiators in the trade talks that will now take place may struggle to restore the norms that prevailed before hostilities began, let alone go further."
U.S. Democrats seek up to $2 trillion to invest in aging infrastructure,"Qatar has found a new way to irritate Saudi Arabia. Since June last year, the tiny gulf state of 2.6 million people has dealt with a hair-raising blockade by its neighbour with relative insouciance. Now it is equally nonchalantly leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the once all-powerful club of which Saudi is the de facto leader."
Japan is stealth threat to 2019 market stability,"The leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees warned Turkey on Tuesday that it risked tough sanctions if it pursued plans to purchase Russian S-400 missile defense systems, and they threatened further legislative action."
Jeff Bezos starts to resemble Sam Walton,"President Xi Jinping has proven himself adept at the art of buying time. The Chinese leader secured a welcome trade war ceasefire with the United States at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. Now for the hard part: structural change. Over the coming weeks, he has opportunities to offer a little more: that will test the minimum required to please Washington hardliners."
Italian banks to bear populism’s burden next year,"The trade-war ceasefire between the United States and China leaves many booby traps for investors. Both countries will put new tariffs on hold while the People's Republic vows to buy more American goods and makes other concessions. Despite the upbeat tone, there are plenty of ways for things to blow up."
Cox: France’s Macron can’t turn 41 fast enough  ,"George H. W. Bush presided over the fall of Soviet communism and led an international effort to foil Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. But the dividends from these historic successes during his one term mostly bypassed the 41st U.S. president, who died at 94 in his Houston home on Friday, and accrued to his successors, including son George W. Bush."
Asia’s beauty giants will apply a western gloss,"The Federal Reserve failed to anticipate the global financial crisis. Its hundreds of economists were too entranced by their abstruse mathematical models to see the storm clouds gathering. One central bank veteran, at least, was more alert. In April 2005, Paul Volcker publicly warned of “dangerous and intractable problems” besetting the U.S. economy. The lanky former Fed chairman remains famous for crushing the runaway inflation of the 1970s. His new memoir, “Kee"
Sony's turnaround will be an activist casting call,It will take two to tango at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping’s supper appointment is at risk of yielding nothing. Beijing hints it won't compromise on its state-directed economic model; Washington hardliners believe their government has already conceded more than it should. Both are wrong.
U.S. cyber allegations risk bigger rift with China,"The curtain is falling on a dramatic inquiry into banking misconduct Down Under. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and others have been battered by the findings of the Royal Commission, with $39 billion wiped off the value of the Big Four lenders this year as investigators found banks taking fees from dead clients’ accounts and pressuring vulnerable borrowers. As the show winds down, investors should brace for a big shake-up."
Doomsday just another opportunity to create alpha,"Experts reckon unrestrained global warming will lop 10 pct off U.S. GDP by 2100. California’s wildfires prove it’s already having disastrous effects. But investors and companies alike can be part of the solution. Plus, Carlos Ghosn’s arrest leaves three carmakers in disarray."
Viewsroom: Dealing in high anxiety,"There’s bad days at most companies, and then there’s a typical 24 hours at Deutsche Bank. Even by the German lender’s low standards, November 29 will stick out as a dies horribilis: a police raid on its Frankfurt HQ followed by an achingly defensive press release, media speculation that the head of its investment bank is under pressure to go, and further dips in its share price. Even so, there are still reasons to believe Deutsche can bounce back."
EU Brexit safety net still means trauma for London   ,"Alan Jope’s tenure at Unilever will be like the company’s popular British spread Marmite: smooth at first with a bitter aftertaste. The consumer giant’s new chief executive can cruise until 2020, but may then have to revisit controversial reforms to its dual-share structure."
McConnell calls for bipartisan U.S. immigration legislation,China's genetically-edited embryos are crying out to regulators. Shocking claims by a scientist who says he altered the genes of twin girls born in November have sparked a firestorm. Clearer guidelines are needed.

"Trump to hold event Friday on 5G, rural broadband: White House","The U.S. Federal Reserve’s first stability checkup downplays some wobbly features. Chairman Jerome Powell says the financial system is in good health, echoing a report from the U.S. central bank on Wednesday. But risks like trade fights and corporate debt only get brief mentions."
East Africa will buck global great rift trend,"“Type A Behavior and Your Heart”, a 1970s bestseller, claimed that heart disease was more likely among people who are involved in an “aggressive and incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time”. The connection with cardiac health has been questioned. But many managers could do with a different title: “Type A behavior and Your Soul”. Carlos Ghosn would be the prime exhibit."
Rio will turn big miners back into big spenders,"L'Occitane could prove a fragrant option for private equity suitors. The Provence-inspired soap-and-skincare brand has struggled of late, in part because of a costly expansion. But a clean balance sheet, prospects in China and a resolutely unglamorous share price suggest an alluring makeover target."
China can afford some pipe dreams in 2019,"Goldman Sachs may wind up paying twice for 1MDB. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund is suing the U.S. investment bank in New York for its role in the Malaysian fund scandal. The damages sought could exceed Goldman’s average annual net profit over three years of $5.4 billion. The longer the fight drags out, the worse the fallout looks. "
Fed hike leaves Powell exposed in multiple ways,"“Do you have a state ID?” That’s the first question you hear when picking up credentials to enter Consensus: Invest, a cryptocurrency conference where the sector’s libertarian, anti-establishment ethos used to reign. After an 80 percent collapse in the price of bitcoin over the past year, digital currency enthusiasts are rethinking old assumptions and looking for support wherever they can find it."
Scooters will soon find city-friendly sweet spot,"Margrethe Vestager is sending mixed signals to scale-hungry European corporates. The competition commissioner may wave through a Dutch mobile merger, Reuters reported, but impose concessions that could sink Siemens and Alstom’s rail tie-up, says the FT. That’ll disappoint politicians and bankers hoping to build EU champions to counter America and China."
Private equity returns will drop a digit,"The relationship between Jack Ma and Xi Jinping just got a little more complicated. State media outed the founder of $400 billion Alibaba as a Chinese Communist Party member. Implying that China’s most famous capitalist is on board with the president’s agenda of exerting influence over technology companies makes good propaganda, but it may not exactly be the case. "
Italy’s budget truce may yet herald 2019 hangover,U.S. President Donald Trump’s Thanksgiving-week absolution of Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents has undermined any claims to global moral leadership by the U.S. administration. But America’s reputational loss today may benefit the Gulf in 2019.
China’s three mobile carriers will become two,"Dolce & Gabbana is going out of fashion in China. Like many companies, the Italian label cashed in on the mainland's ambitious urbanites. A disastrous advertising campaign has turned into a prime example of how fast the same shoppers can unravel a brand."
Shinzo Abe will strike accord with Donald Trump,"Flawed parallels with the financial crisis won’t save Theresa May’s Brexit plan. Back in 2008, panicking investors helped the U.S. government force its bank bailout through Congress at the second time of asking. The British prime minister might hope for a similar response if parliament rejects her deal to leave the European Union. But a replay is unlikely."
The 2019 stock market reversal: how it happened,"The outgoing director of the U.S. Secret Service Randolph ""Tex"" Alles said on Monday that he was not fired, describing the shift as part of an ""orderly transition in leadership"" across the Department of Homeland Secretary."
Ex-Obama White House Counsel expects to be charged over Ukraine work: statement,"Nissan and Renault’s standoff could quickly descend into a demolition derby. The Japanese carmaker wants more say in the alliance. Given the partnership’s lopsided governance, Nissan’s best bet would be to snap up shares in Renault, neutralising its controlling stake. The exit of Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn makes such a radical move easier."
Explainer: What might be blacked out of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?,"A Chinese company is looking beyond trash for treasure. Nasdaq-listed Yulong Eco-Materials, which recycles bricks and concrete, has decided to become an art investor instead. It just acquired Michelangelo's ""Crucifixion"" for $75 million after restructuring its business model last month by offloading the waste hauling operation to some of its directors and issuing stock to buy a rare sapphire. It’s a risky form of creative destruction."
Beto O'Rourke's past support for charter schools scrutinized in 2020 White House bid,"Call it the MbS discount. Since Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder by Saudi Arabian agents in early October, equity and bond prices in Riyadh have slumped. U.S. President Donald Trump’s indifference to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s alleged role in the journalist’s murder may offer a temporary lift for the Saudi market. But too many other problems lie in wait."
Goldman Sachs will spend 2019 in velvet handcuffs,"Something must give in France’s telecoms market. Three tycoons and state-backed Orange  are bleeding each other dry in a price war: a monthly mobile phone tariff can now cost little more than a pain au chocolat. If billionaire owners like Iliad’s  Xavier Niel, Patrick Drahi of Altice   and Martin Bouygues can set aside their egos, four will become three in 2019."
Didi will seize the wheel of a Chinese carmaker,"Cabinet resignations, an angry coalition partner and a skittish currency greeted UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft agreement to quit the EU. Breakingviews columnists examine whether the current mess leads to Brexit with an EU deal, without a deal, or even to a new referendum."
UK audit reform leaves unfinished business,"Short-selling is tough, but picking winners may be just as difficult. Andrew Left’s Citron Research, known for negative reports on stocks, is now backing both Chinese electric-car maker Nio and Elon Musk’s Tesla. Conceding the dominance of Musk’s creation and then betting on a rival is a challenging combination."
China’s economic slouch will rattle cult of Xi,"The relationship between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping hangs on big numbers and big egos. The two leaders’ upcoming meeting in the Argentinian capital as part of the G20 summit is weighing on markets. Despite discord among his aides, the U.S. president has the autonomy to strike a deal if China offers the right incentives."
Indian unicorns will feast on richer pastures,"Brexit and Facebook might not seem to have much in common, other than that they are both made-up two-syllable words which are currently gathering a lot of negative publicity. However, there are three deeper, and deeply alarming, similarities between Britain’s departure from the European Union and Mark Zuckerberg’s social network. They can be summed up in simple slogans."
Facebook might be the JPMorgan of the tech world,France is one of the few developed economies where the finance minister calls a press conference to mop up a corporate scandal. The problem for Bruno Le Maire and President Emmanuel Macron is that sticking their noses into Renault’s affairs risks fraying a partnership with Nissan that is essential to the French carmaker’s future.
Canada faces off against vampire squid to south,"Donald Trump is kindling a trade war with China. Yet in parts of the country’s private sector, there is surprising, if discreet, support for the U.S. president."
The Exchange: Gary Shteyngart,"Attorney General William Barr has provided only a glimpse of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the inquiry into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, with many details expected to emerge when the document is finally released."
SoftBank writedown will cloud Son’s way forward,"Bitcoin’s latest slide is blowing digital stardust to the winds. Many fans dreamed the cryptocurrency would consign conventional finance to the dustbin, but a drop below $5,000 is proving it to be more vulnerable than stocks and bonds to investor funk. Bitcoin’s flaw remains its lack of fundamental value."
J&J’s talc crisis will linger for years,"Société Générale can finally put its litigation worries behind it, almost. After months of waiting and breathless updates predicting a settlement within “weeks”, the French bank has agreed a $1.4 billion settlement with US authorities over sanctions violations related to Cuba. The snag is that the deal comes with a three-year deferred prosecution agreement to ensure good behaviour. Higher compliance spending will make it harder for boss Frederic Oudea to tackle t"
Mnuchin says he needs more time to decide on releasing Trump's taxes,"The Carlos Ghosn fiasco at Nissan hints at all the hallmarks of the bad old days of Japan Inc, starting with derisory oversight by a board whose few independent directors include a race-car driver. Auditors, Ernst & Young ShinNihon, who also looked after the books at scandal-tainted Olympus and Toshiba, may have missed something here too. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's campaign to bolster faith in Japan Inc has hit a major speed-bump.   "
U.S. Senate bill mandates review of nuclear power cooperation with other nations,"Renault looks like the biggest loser in a scandal that has engulfed Carlos Ghosn. The French carmaker’s chief executive is being ousted as chairman of alliance partner Nissan, which said on Monday that he under-reported his salary. That’s bad for Renault since the Japanese company would have greater clout were a lopsided partnership to now be renegotiated."
Bernie Sanders puts focus on healthcare with Medicare for All bill,The new book “Billion Dollar Whale” chronicles the Malaysian mega-scandal involving Goldman Sachs and Leonardo DiCaprio. Co-author Tom Wright joined Breakingviews in Hong Kong to discuss how alleged mastermind Jho Low pulled it off and what the saga’s next chapter may bring.
China’s social credit poses rising risk to CEOs,"Nissan and Renault are paying the price for underestimating key-man risk. The Japanese carmaker’s Chairman Carlos Ghosn – also chief executive of its French partner – understated his compensation in official filings, Nissan said on Monday. His probable exit makes resolving the lopsided partnership harder."
Review: The attack of the killer fridges has begun,"Making a success of buying Finland’s Amer Sports would be a marathon not a sprint for Anta Sports Products. The Chinese suitor’s stock has suffered since it approached the owner of winter gear brands Salomon and Arc’teryx in September with a $5.3 billion cash offer. Shareholders may be worried about the high price and the prospect of initially lower margins and dividends, but the company’s experience with Fila suggests the deal could pay off."
Trump can get what he wants from Saudi in 2019,"Las Vegas made its reputation on sin. So it might seem fitting that the cannabis industry chose to locate its biggest annual gathering in the city this week. And just as Vegas has used conferences to try to clean up its reputation – it’s now the venue for more than 21,000 confabs a year - the weed business is shifting in that direction, too. The drug remains federally prohibited in the United States, and less than a month has passed since Canada made it legal "
Viewsroom: French misery gives Italy some company,"The internet is both a blessing and curse. It has given consumers around the world access to an unimaginable trove of music, movies, television shows and books, all at the touch of a button. But it sometimes seems as if the deluge is watering down popular culture – and undermining the economics of the artists and companies we rely on to keep us entertained."
Italy saves EU budget battle for another day,"Sterling is the most sensitive barometer of Brexit fears. The pound slumps each time it looks more likely that Britain may crash out of the European Union without a deal. At the same time, however, UK government bond prices strengthen because bleaker economic prospects mean higher interest rates are less likely. The clearest sign that investors have had enough of the United Kingdom would be when both weaken at the same time."
China’s murky moves hand Trump more ammo,U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he made the controversial decision to recognize Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights after getting a quick history lesson during a conversation on a different subject.
Memo to Theresa May: How to save Brexit as well,"In the words of its supporters, Brexit was supposed to allow Britain to “take back control” from the European Union. The country’s banks, however, are looking more like hostages to fortune."
Hadas: What oil price volatility is trying to say,"A slump in new Asian equities is bringing some welcome sanity to valuations. Having raised a collective $62 billion in nine months via 480 listings, according to consultancy EY, overheated Asian stock markets are finally cooling off. Deals from Tencent and others are being delayed or repriced in an overdue correction. With luck, more rationality will creep in elsewhere, too."
Challenge to Theresa May clarifies Brexit endgames,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is pushing the wrong kind of independence. The social network’s chief executive on Thursday revealed he plans to set up an external committee to help police fake news and hateful content. The move follows yet more revelations about how poorly he and others dealt with Russian meddling in U.S. elections. Outsourcing decisions won’t fix Facebook’s culture, though. Removing Zuckerberg as chair would be a step in the right direction."
Pernod Ricard served a shot of Diageo by Elliott,"Digital titans like Alphabet and Apple may rule the roost, but EU rules on data privacy are helping startups flourish on the other side of the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Facebook’s inability to police fake content spreads to Africa. Plus: Mumbai’s ride-share drivers go on strike."
"Pentagon to find places to potentially house up to 5,000 unaccompanied migrant children","The British government is finally confronting its Brexit dilemma. Two cabinet ministers quit on Thursday morning, weakening Prime Minister Theresa May and narrowing the already-slim chances of parliament approving her divorce deal from the European Union. That makes the two alternatives of a chaotic Brexit or another referendum more likely."
Mexico government slams U.S. border slowdown as 'very bad idea',"The boss of a leading Chinese e-commerce group was asked recently what job other than the current one, would be most interesting to consider. The answer: receptionist at rival Pinduoduo, ""because I’d like to know how they do it."" Investors may have a similar response following a report from an American fund betting against the $19 billion three-year-old firm, once dubbed the world’s fastest-growing internet seller, that claims it has been fiddling with its num"
U.S. Senate confirms Abizaid as ambassador to Saudi Arabia,"Is money more like gold or like motor oil? The answer to that fundamental question helps determine how large fiscal deficits should be, and how best to find the money to close the gap between tax revenues and government expenditures."
Activism anxiety will grip French establishment,"Theresa May’s Brexit compromise has confirmed Britain’s hard choices. After a year of intense negotiations – mostly with members of her own party – the prime minister late on Tuesday secured a draft deal to leave the European Union. The agreement with Brussels would shackle the United Kingdom to the bloc without the influence it enjoyed as a member. Opponents have two options: crash out next March, or call another referendum."
China-U.S. trade war will get a lot more personal,"Wall Street can help fight wildfires. California is being ravaged by the most deadly and destructive conflagration in its history. Last year such fires caused $18 billion in damage and consumed up to $180 billion of economic output, or 6.5 percent of GDP, in the Golden State, according to AccuWeather. A new financing tool can reduce fire risk and its impact on water, air and livelihoods."
Google finds Congress still searching for a clue,"Jeff Bezos is spreading jobs and disappointment by splitting his ballyhooed second headquarters between New York City and greater Washington, D.C. The decision enables the Amazon boss to tap two of the nation’s deepest pools of technology talent. The unconventional choice of two conventional cities also aggravates the socioeconomic divisions that plague America."
Big Tech has a mission in U.S. flyover country,U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that sanctions imposed by Washington on ships transporting Venezuelan crude to Cuba target Havana's role in propping the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
“Pere Noel” Macron won’t cheer marchers or markets,"Holding one of the world’s largest web conferences in Lisbon highlights an uncomfortable truth: Europe has produced vanishingly few large internet companies. Top billing at last week’s Web Summit in the Portuguese capital therefore went to American giants. Executives from Apple, Slack, Pinterest, Microsoft  and Google  (twice) all took to the main stage in the city’s cavernous Altice Arena. The only European businesses with dedicated centre-stage sessions were Ro"
Global equities offer value trap in 2019,"SoftBank is turning to dividends to dial up the appeal for its Japanese mobile unit. Masayoshi Son’s conglomerate wants to raise as much as $23 billion with an initial public offering due later this month. That implies a chunky premium to its rivals, and leans on generous payouts too. A looming price war will make it difficult, though, to keep up promises to hand out almost twice as much of its earnings as the likes of NTT Docomo and KDDI."
Apple case underscores Chinese tech ties that bind,"Stan Lee, who died at the age of 95, built an Incredible Hulk-sized box office legacy. Through Marvel, the comic-book creator helped whip up a brigade of characters – including the tetchy green giant among others – on which movie studios now depend for audiences. He also showed, inadvertently, that even superheroes need powerful friends."
Uber and Lyft race to get through open IPO window,"SoftBank’s mobile phone unit could be worth around $70 billion when it floats, according to Bloomberg. Selling more than a third of the stock would make its initial public offering the biggest on record. That valuation could be too aggressive, though, according to Breakingviews calculations. With a heavy focus on retail investors, it’s ordinary Japanese who will need to be persuaded to pay up."
The Exchange: Joe Kaeser,"One of the more perverse ideas of modern economics is that an abundance of natural resources is a handicap rather than a blessing. In Africa and elsewhere, excessive mineral wealth appears to have imposed inordinate costs on regular people. Now Nicholas Shaxson has extended the concept to finance, arguing that overdeveloped banks and markets can also prove too much of a good thing."
Breakdown: Brexit maze has four flawed ways out,"SoftBank’s many investments can be hard to see clearly. The nearly $100 billion Vision Fund, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, held 38 stakes at the end of September. Some of the biggest and best-known weren’t among them. Following these deals creates a blur."
White House will appeal ruling against returning asylum seekers to Mexico,"The U.S. House of Representatives will soon be controlled by lawmakers opposing President Trump. That gives them more scope to push their agenda on trade, infrastructure and a perennial bogeyman, the banks. But as Republicans still run the Senate, policy changes will be minimal."
"Facebook, Google defend efforts to remove hate speech before Congress","Politicians are once again trying to push central banks around. Donald Trump and his counterparts in India, Turkey, Russia and South Africa are complaining that the monetary authorities are resisting the popular will. The pressure is quite justified, and also totally wrongheaded."
Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary offered resignation to Trump: Nielsen,"Elon Musk is finally getting his adult supervision. Robyn Denholm, finance chief at Australian telecom operator Telstra, will move from her boardroom seat at Tesla to the head of the table – and oversee the $60 billion electric-car maker's erratic chief executive full-time. She will have to get tougher, though."
Unsavoury disclosure spoils Chinese food delivery,"China’s bruised offshore currency market is scarred for life. As the yuan nears 7 per dollar, its weakest since 2008, officials are attacking short-sellers exploiting opportunities in overseas derivatives trade. The People’s Republic is trying to manage what are, in effect, two currencies: that’s an unsustainable plan."
Review: The uncertain new world of labour,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks, while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact."
Ericsson debacle exposes costs of anti-Huawei push,"Obamacare’s roots are growing too deep to dislodge. The Democratic Party wrested back control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, thus effectively ending Republican hopes of overturning former President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. Even voters in heavily Republican states are warming to the law."
Breakingviews-Trade truce gives China room to loosen up,"The pollsters got it more or less right this time. The Democrats will run the U.S. House of Representatives, securing a majority of the 435 seats in Tuesday’s midterm elections, according to news networks projections. With the Republicans keeping control of the Senate, though, Democrats will need political smarts to avoid being painted as the new obstructionists."
Mike Bloomberg can learn from Thomson Reuters,"Cloud-software firm Qualtrics deserves an equivocal “yes” from shareholders. The company wants a valuation of more than $4 billion in its upcoming initial public offering. It’s a stronger company than recently listed rival SurveyMonkey. But its undemocratic, double-barreled supervoting stock should give investors pause."
Viewsroom: Trade war pause may only delay fight,"Few people have dedicated their careers to expanding international trade and globalism like Lamy, the former head of the WTO and EU commissioner. But rising rhetoric and increased tariffs between the U.S. and China have him worried, as he tells Rob Cox and Liam Proud in Paris."
South African blackouts mask $30 bln power problem,"Acne and other skin creams have had a spotty record at Nestlé, but a buyout group might do better. A unit at the world’s biggest food group that makes Botox rival Dysport may fetch at least 6 billion Swiss francs ($6 billion). Rival consumer groups may be put off by the business’s products and low margins, but they could appeal to a private equity firm.    Facing pressure from activist Dan Loeb, Nestlé Chief Executive Mark Schneider announced a review of the divi"
Huawei settles into eye of geopolitical storm,"President Xi Jinping has entered Shanghai in the high-stakes race for technology stocks. China's leader granted the city a so-called ""science and innovation"" board. It also will test a looser U.S.-style system for new listings – an overdue reform. Yet officials may rue the volatility it’s apt to bring."
AT&T fails to grasp the true value of “Friends”,"Corporate America is giving the country’s politicians a civics lesson. Walmart, Tyson Foods, Levi Strauss and hundreds of other firms are encouraging their employees to cast a ballot in this week’s U.S. congressional elections. They are acting largely because a mishmash of state laws and the lack of a national holiday make voting a challenge."
The Exchange: Erika Karp talks climate change,"As the world investment spotlight illuminated Riyadh last month, bosses of limelight-shunning Naspers stayed at home to unveil plans to pour $315 million into South African tech startups. That’s small compared to SoftBank’s $93 billion Vision Fund, powered in part by Saudi petrodollars. But the emerging market internet giant’s quietly-quietly $8 billion tech war chest is still worth watching."
"Trump praises Egypt's Sisi despite concerns about human rights, Russian arms","Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro threatens to short-circuit China’s energy plans. Beijing-backed energy companies hope to invest tens of billions of dollars in Brazilian power, but the president-elect has warned of Chinese intentions. Firms like State Grid would bring a lot of cash and expertise – and Brazil could use both. But populist suspicion might overrule commercial logic."
U.S. House Democrats call off budget vote after liberal revolt,"Tough talk by the United States on Iran sanctions is butting up against oil economics. Eight countries can temporarily keep importing Iranian oil without defying the restrictions set to go into effect next week. Top U.S. diplomat Mike Pompeo says the aim is still to go to zero. With a domestic election and Saudi Arabia in a mess, it’s a way to keep acting tough while limiting the risk of oil price spikes. "
U.S. senators introduce bill to sanction Turkish officials over detentions,U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he recommended former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
Hadas: Conglomerates will never die,"Josh Ryan-Collins has written a book about the housing crisis without mentioning housing. If he’s right, policymakers should take off their hard hats and study the peculiarities of bank credit allocation and land markets. Twenty-somethings from London to Los Angeles can be forgiven a collective groan."
China hangs corruption sword over tech giants,"Heard the one about the City grandee atop a British bank run by a Wall Street investment banker? Barclays investors certainly have. They will remember that when UK corporate financier Marcus Agius had a double act with hard-charging Chief Executive Bob Diamond it ended in vaudeville, with both eventually resigning over the Libor scandal. Appointing Rothschild & Co’s Nigel Higgins to oversee Chief Executive Jes Staley should end less disastrously."
U.S. bond yields turn from green light to red,"Macquarie is widening the gap both at home and abroad. The $28 billion Australian investment bank is set for another record year, thanks to a first-half lift from its commodities business. Profitability stands apart and local lenders are under scrutiny. New boss Shemara Wikramanayake will need to keep up the impressive resilience in far choppier markets.     "
Cox: Why I’m relocating to Paris in the year ahead,"Oliver Bullough's book ""Moneyland"" delves into the parallel world of super-rich super-crooks, where rules are for the little people. He discusses wealth, corruption, tax havens and how to fix it all with Clara Ferreira Marques and Nicholas Shaxson, author of “The Finance Curse”."
Cox: Why I’m relocating to Paris in the year ahead,"Apple’s pricey strategy carries risk. Making its new iPhones more expensive helped boost the tech giant’s revenue 20 percent in the latest quarter. Now Tim Cook is applying the same formula to the company’s Macs, iPads and accessories. But a growth warning suggests even Apple fans may have sticker shock."
Tencent Music strains to hit Spotify's high notes,"A China trade-secrets case in the United States may have just brought sanctions closer. State-backed chipmaker Fujian Jinhua was indicted for allegedly stealing designs from U.S. rival Micron Technology. It had already been effectively barred from buying U.S. parts, so this raises the stakes. The idea of targeted, government-mandated punishments for industrial espionage, floated under the last administration, could be in play again."
Euro zone reform leaves crisis fault lines intact,"Americans go to the polls next week. But in one California town, the fiercest debate isn’t whether Republicans or Democrats triumph in midterm elections, but over the legacy of a long-dead president, William McKinley. Citizens will vote on Tuesday on whether to remove a century-old statue from their town square of the “Napoleon of Protection”, who was assassinated in 1901."
Big Weed is better off without Big Tobacco embrace,Germany’s chancellor won’t seek re-election in 2021 and is stepping down as party chair next month after electoral setbacks. It may herald a rightward swing at home and less EU unity. Plus: investors’ embrace of Brazil’s far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro may prove risky.
U.S.-China talks depend on speaking same language,Sterling is drawing more cheer than bankers from signs that Britain may be closer to securing London basic access to the European Union’s financial services market. The bankers are probably the better judge of how much there is to celebrate at the moment.
Qatar’s OPEC exit is a deft way to irritate Saudi,BHP is atoning for past M&A sins. The world's largest miner will hand back all $10.4 billion from its U.S. shale sale in a dividend and giant buyback. A nudge from pushy investor Elliott Management and greater deal discipline have led to a better use of capital than in the last commodities cycle.
"U.S. congressional committee leaders warn Turkey on F-35, S-400",U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that China will be buying a lot of product from the United States as the world's two largest economies try to sort out a trade dispute.
Trump decision to cut Central American aid won't be reversed soon: top official,Bitcoin’s short history is a triumph of hope over experience. The digital money is marking its first decade with a punishing slump. Fraud and regulatory zeal have dried up the issuance of rival cryptocurrencies. The underlying blockchain technology has yet to produce its first killer app. It’s a long way from the revolution envisaged by founder Satoshi Nakamoto.
U.S. Air Force General Hyten nominated to be next vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff,"Like its erotic namesake, wealth-porn can distract otherwise sensible people. It is all too easy to stare mindlessly at descriptions of billions and trillions of dollars and to relish tales of grand excesses of spending. What really matters about the rise of big fortunes, though, is not the thrill of luxury, but the effect of concentrated wealth on society."
Xi deftly practices the diplomacy of buying time,"Like its erotic namesake, wealth-porn can distract otherwise sensible people.

Trade-war detente leaves booby traps for investors,"WH Group, $11 billion owner of U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, faces a fierce battle on two fronts. Swine fever is sweeping China, while tariffs hammer American markets. It will get worse before it gets better."
Bush paid history's economic dividends forward,"Facebook is heading into an earnings pincer movement. Sales growth at the $410 billion social-media network slowed in the third quarter, the company said on Tuesday. Combating that and other problems means spending more, hitting both top and bottom lines. That may force Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to take rash countermeasures."
Review: Paul Volcker’s exemplary life,"Mass shootings happen in an instant and grab headlines. A business and investment shift away from the firearms industry is happening more subtly. FedEx, the U.S. shipping group, is ending a program that offers discounts for business members of the National Rifle Association, the company confirmed to Breakingviews."
China and U.S. can give a little in Argentina,"Jamal Khashoggi’s murder will have repercussions well beyond Saudi Arabia. The grisly affair poses a potential economic risk for one of the kingdom’s most loyal allies: Egypt. The Arab nation of 100 million is highly dependent on foreign exchange remittances from Egyptian workers in Saudi, and a steady flow of tourists from the Gulf, both of which could be threatened by instability in Riyadh."
Smarting Aussie lenders brace for Banking 2.0,"U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross has picked the right fight with China at last. His department has put a provincial, government-backed chipmaker under an embargo similar to that which battered telecoms giant ZTE. Fujian Jinhua has been accused of IP theft by $39 billion Micron Technology. This retaliation presumes guilt. Even so, targeting small, wayward firms is smarter than blanket tariffs."
Viewsroom: Climate risk is investing opportunity,"Angela Merkel has called time on her own tenure. The politician who has been Germany’s chancellor for 13 years has decided to not seek re-election as chairwoman of her party, the Christian Democrats (CDU). While she nevertheless wants to serve her full term as chancellor until 2021, her country and the rest of Europe will inevitably start looking ahead to what could be a more polarising era."
Deutsche Bank’s new dark clouds have silver lining,A rare mining snub from China sends a bearish signal on iron ore. State-run giant Chinalco has stepped back from a 2016 deal to take control of the $23 billion-plus Simandou project in Guinea from partner Rio Tinto. That's a headache for the Anglo-Australian heavyweight and a blow to West Africa's mining ambitions. It's also a hint that even Beijing sees cooler long-term demand ahead for the steel ingredient.
New Unilever CEO’s hard graft will come later,"U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to deter Russia from meddling in U.S. elections by threatening stiff sanctions on its banking, energy and defense industries and sovereign debt."
China's gene-edited babies cry out to regulators,"RBS is still finding its state embrace uncomfortable. In the decade since the UK lender wound up with a majority government stake it has been dragged over the coals for its bonuses, its lending policies and allegedly driving healthy businesses to the wall. Friday’s 100 million pound provision to cover the risk of a messy UK exit from the EU is the latest sign of its awkward state/private sector hybrid."
"Trump's Fed picks pan liberals, praise Trump","So much for Hong Kong’s Hollywood ending. STX Entertainment, the studio behind “Bad Moms” and Jackie Chan’s “The Foreigner,” allowed its proposed initial public offering in the Asian financial hub to lapse this week. A rocky market is easy to blame, but losing an international issuer with Chinese backers will sting the exchange, which has struggled to escape its parochial proclivities."
Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida resort to remain in custody,"Amazon’s ad initiative is proving useful. The company’s third-quarter sales mainly pertaining to advertising – the “other” category, officially – soared. As a challenger to Facebook and Alphabet, both mired in data scandals, Jeff Bezos’ firm risks negative attention by plunging into the advertising business and targeting users. But the extra dough helps, and thanks to other revenue streams, Amazon has less to lose."
U.S. advertising groups create privacy bill coalition,"Alphabet’s ad machine is aiding Tim Cook’s data case. The Google parent raked in more revenue and profit during the third quarter. The stronger the $730 billion firm gets, the more scrutiny it will attract from watchdogs who want to safeguard consumer data. The Apple boss’s willingness to call for tighter privacy restrictions is a telling sign."
Fed’s stability checkup downplays wobbly features,Danish lender Danske has already lost its chief executive on news that one of its Estonian branches was used to launder Russian money.

L'Occitane buyout could be a fragrant option,Many economists love Uber. They look at the quasi-taxi company’s aggressive disruption of local monopolies as a case study in the power and wonder of free markets. They could hardly be more wrong.
Goldman Sachs could wind up paying twice for 1MDB,"An influential Saudi Arabian prince once called Qatar, a spit of sand sticking into the Persian Gulf like a thumb, nothing more than “300 people and a television channel.” Such disdain inspired Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to initiate a four-nation blockade of the country. But not a year and a half later, the young Saudi monarch has acknowledged what has become apparent to the world: Qatar is doing just fine. "
Crypto disruptors want a hug from Wall St,"The recent departure of UBS’s key rainmaker Andrea Orcel may have left some observers convinced that boss Sergio Ermotti now has an alluring opportunity to shrink the investment bank in favour of more highly rated wealth management. If so, they had better think again."
EU sends mixed signals to scale-hungry corporates,"Beijing is limiting its output of rare earths, according to Adamas Intelligence. That tackles lingering oversupply of the tough-to-mine minerals, but could easily also starve foreign buyers of key ingredients like cerium and neodymium, used in catalysts, electronics and weapons - a drastic trade war escalation that would punish profit margins. An overdue rush to develop new supply outside China, though, will come too late."
Jack Ma and Xi Jinping: dubious comrades in arms,"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence warned Turkey on Wednesday against buying a Russian S-400 anti-missile system, keeping up the pressure on its NATO ally to abandon the purchase that Washington considers a threat to U.S. military equipment."
Trump’s Saudi amorality can make Gulf great again,"Tesla is back on the road, with its battery charged at least one-quarter full. The delayed ramp-up of its Model 3 revved up the electric-car maker’s latest sales and drove it into the black in the three months to September."
Dolce & Gabbana’s Chinese outfit proves reversible,"The New York attorney general wants Exxon Mobil to pay. After several years investigating the company’s communications with shareholders, Barbara Underwood unveiled a suit that claims the $340 billion oil giant has misled investors about how climate change regulation would affect its business. Shareholders weren’t dupes, though. Their revolt last year forced the company to start addressing the issue. Legal heat should prod Exxon's owners to demand more than bab"
Brexit vote plan is more twerp than TARP,"In his A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens contrasted the trajectories of London and Paris amid the revolutionary upheaval of the eighteenth century. UK-based Barclays and Germany’s Deutsche Bank, both recently subject to radical internal transformation, provide a comparable study in the diverging fortunes of their modern-day investment banks. "
Outgoing Secret Service director says he was not fired,"President Xi Jinping's southern tour wasted an opportunity to re-inspire the country's private investors and its trading partners. This week he retraced the steps of reformist icon Deng Xiaoping in Guangdong province, an export powerhouse that generates over $1.3 trillion in GDP and drove an economic boom. But it was an awkward, low-key affair, shrouded in secrecy. Far from announcing fresh reform that might help the private sector, Xi barely spoke during a ri"
"U.S., Brazilian vice presidents discuss Venezuela pressure at White House","Kevin Hassett is an economist who might have proved a champion of reason – and reasoning – in President Donald Trump’s administration. He has blown it with a report from the Council of Economic Advisers, which he chairs. It’s a thinly veiled political tilt at the economic straw man of socialism, issued just days before America’s midterm congressional elections."
Factbox: Possible successors to Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen,"The Mega Millions lottery jackpot, available in 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, has reached a record $1.6 billion. A successful punter or several will become at least as well off as founders of a hefty Silicon Valley technology unicorn. Rubbing shoulders on rich lists might rankle with startup billionaires – but their wealth owes plenty to luck, too."
How Nissan could get the upper hand with Renault,"Australia's prime minister in 2008 told Breakingviews how his government decided to spend some 6 pct of GDP on tax breaks, infrastructure and cash payments to citizens. That helped the country heavily exposed to China, commodities, finance and housing avoid a recession – just."
Michelangelo deal is work of abstract art,"Company bosses' shelf lives are getting shorter. Thomas Falk is stepping down as chief executive at Kimberly-Clark after 16 years, following in the recent footsteps of longstanding bosses at PepsiCo and Campbell Soup. It’s a sign of accelerating executive turnover at consumer-goods and industrial companies."
Saudi stock market’s “MbS discount” to get worse ,"Finance and business will find Libor a painful and expensive habit to kick. Financial contracts worth more than $300 trillion are linked to the discredited London Interbank Offered Rate. Switching to new benchmark interest rates could disrupt economies as well as markets. Avoiding that outcome will take a lot of money, time, and a willingness to reconcile conflicting interests. Breakingviews explains what’s at stake."
French telco fight will become ménage à trois,"Epic natural-resource wealth, a ruling family becoming more progressive, and a pot of cash to invest in diversifying the economy. Until recently, asset managers looking for all that, plus Gulf exposure, would think first of Saudi Arabia. Ditto start-ups and governments attracted by the $45 billion pumped into SoftBank’s Vision Fund or $20 billion destined for a Blackstone infrastructure fund from the kingdom. With Riyadh’s reputation now crushed following the "

Short-seller tries tricky electric-car U-turn,"KKR’s $7.1 billion splurge on a Fiat Chrysler-owned supplier is sending auto industry valuations into a spin. The buyout group is paying 16 times next year's earnings for Magneti Marelli, which will be merged with KKR portfolio company Calsonic Kansei. That's double what publicly traded car-parts peers are worth, according to Refinitiv data. Meanwhile, shares of marquee manufacturers trade at an even bigger discount. "
"G20 showdown hangs on big numbers, big egos","China’s technology hub warrants an upgrade. Nearly four decades after the southern market town of Shenzhen was transformed into a buzzing metropolis with a roughly $320 billion economy, it makes sense to designate the area as something like a province."
Hadas: Dumb ideas undermine Brexit and Facebook,"If Saudi Arabia was a corporation, its executive chairman would now consider replacing its chief executive, whose underlings have officially been accused of murdering an unarmed civilian in an overseas branch – the consulate in Istanbul. Saudi is not a company. It is an absolute monarchy, with a king and a crown prince rather than a chairman and CEO."
France can best help Renault by cutting it free,"Canada’s former prime minister, in office through the financial meltdown a decade ago, is an advocate for conservative politics with a small “c.” He talked to Breakingviews about the revamped NAFTA, Donald Trump’s standoff with China and the pros and cons of the loonie."
Cox: Trump is surprisingly popular – in China,"Italy’s radical government is trying a risky gamble. Its promise to boost spending has triggered a clash with the European Commission. Lengthy procedures mean the spat could drag on until European Parliament elections in May. With radical parties gaining ground, the next Commission may be more lenient or weaker. But intense market pressure could spoil the plan."
Factbox: Five things to look for in Mueller's Trump-Russia report,"China’s gummed-up credit system is threatening growth. The economy expanded 6.5 percent in the third quarter, missing expectations, as other indicators cooled too. The campaign to quash financial risk has squeezed private companies, and exhorting banks to lend more to small firms won’t cut it in the long run. Officials have little choice but to let shadow lenders find their place in the sun."
U.S. House judiciary chair seeks any Mueller summaries on Trump-Russia probe report,"Uncle Sam is finally delivering a spanking to company babysitters. The U.S. Department of Justice announced last week that it will cut back on hiring private monitors for corporate wrongdoers. Once trusted to keep the likes of Citigroup and Apple in line, these super-nannies have often turned out to be meddlers fond of excessive oversight and multi-million dollar fees.  "
Explainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?,Bankers and officials have ditched a huge Saudi shindig after Turkey accused the kingdom of killing a prominent journalist – but big deal fees and oil reserves make the kingdom hard to shun. Breakingviews columnists discuss the financial ramifications of the diplomatic crisis.
Bitcoin’s slide blows digital stardust to winds,"Only the threat of chaos might break the Brexit deadlock. With just over five months to go until Britain formally leaves the European Union, talks over its departure have reached an impasse. Prime Minister Theresa May faces irreconcilable demands from EU negotiators in Brussels and hard-line parliamentarians at home. To avoid a disorderly exit, at least one side must cave."
SocGen U.S. settlement has sting in the tail,"Giant consumer goods companies are testing their pricing power. Charging more for products helped Unilever and Nestlé boost underlying revenue by 3.8 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in the third quarter. Both need the hikes to offset rising costs. The risk is that price-conscious customers go elsewhere."
Nissan puts Japan's governance drive into reverse,"The Trump administration is maintaining support for prospective Federal Reserve nominee Stephen Moore following reports the conservative commentator has had legal problems, a White House adviser said on Tuesday."
Renault is biggest loser in Carlos Ghosn debacle,"China’s winks at punters hint at intervention. Top officials have been trotted out over recent days to reassure investors fretting over a near-25 percent stock slump this year. A thaw is not far away, they say; an aggressive deleveraging campaign is on hold too. That’s all in Beijing’s playbook. If markets keep falling, more active policy support comes next."
"The Exchange: 1MDB, Goldman, Jho Low and Leo","Apple founder Steve Jobs once wanted “to go to thermonuclear war” against Google for – he said – copying the software that powers the iPhone. Now his company and Alphabet, which owns the giant search engine, are bound by tight financial ties. Payments from Google may account for over 10 percent of Apple’s profit, a figure that is likely to rise."
Renault-Nissan pays price for Ghosn key-man risk,"Climate activism is nearing the final frontier – and at just the right moment. Last week’s report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that keeping the rise in the Earth’s temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius requires us to make unprecedented changes by 2030 in the way we use energy resources. One big stumbling block is a lack of enough accurate data. That will soon change, though, as Google, Planet, MethaneScan and a host of space agenci"
Anta deal would be a marathon not a sprint,"Financial markets have some things in common with professional sport. Investors and fans are both desperate for winners and despondent about losing. They are passionate about little ups and downs, while outsiders often find the rules arcane and the enthusiasm weird. And for both, all the jumping and screaming has little effect on the rest of the economy."
Cannabis industry shops for a suit and tie,"Japan’s big banks may be hoping to benefit from the retreat of global rivals from Riyadh. The accusation that Saudi Arabia engaged in state-sponsored murder has led top U.S. and European bank bosses to pull out of attending next week’s Future Investment Initiative. For Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  and Mizuho Financial Group, though, the fallout could present an opportunity to snag more of Saudi’s fee wallet. "
Review: New tech brings golden age of media,Netflix has managed to pull off the double axel of retail. The $145 billion streaming-video company has both the scale of shopping giant Walmart and the pricing power of luxury-jewelry outfit Tiffany. Chief Executive Reed Hastings’ next trick is to work out how to maintain both labels.
Watch UK bonds to see when there’s a real crisis,"David Solomon steps into his new role at Goldman Sachs at a flattering moment. The Wall Street group reported a 21 percent increase in earnings for the third quarter of 2018. The investment bank that Solomon used to run put in a strong performance. And the firm’s annualized return on equity of 13.1 percent beat uptown rival Morgan Stanley. Big numbers aren’t really Solomon’s challenge, though – people are."
Trump says he made Golan Heights decision after a quick history lesson,"It’s not often one imagines Jamie Dimon with a halo over his coiffured head. But that, in effect, is what European banks have given the JPMorgan  boss by dithering over whether to attend the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia next week. The accusation that Riyadh had engaged in state-sponsored murder left all attendees facing the awkward choice of whether to bail and potentially miss out on fat fees, or go and risk pariah status."
New York man charged with threatening to kill Muslim U.S. lawmaker Ilhan Omar,"China’s pledged stocks cast a long shadow. Shares have been used as collateral for some $220 billion of loans in the People’s Republic, a practice which threatens to exacerbate a nearly $2 trillion selloff this year. Beijing will step in to contain the immediate risk, but higher lending costs and moral hazard will hurt for longer."
"U.S. ratchets up pressure on Venezuela, Cuban backers","Deutsche Bank was credited with coming through the 2008 crisis in better shape than many of its rivals.

Rates pain compounds UK banks’ Brexit misery,"U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is against expanding the nine-member Supreme Court, a proposal some liberal activists have advocated to effectively reverse President Donald Trump's appointment of conservative judges."
Asian IPO slump brings welcome valuation sanity,"The Wall Street tail is wagging the Washington dog. In the past, Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi would have met with robust condemnation from the United States government. American banks and companies would then reluctantly pass up the chance to compete for lucrative business. But in the last few days a stream of luminaries headed by JPMorgan  CEO Jamie Dimon have turned that dynamic on its head."
Mark Zuckerberg pushes wrong kind of independence,"Bank of America is punching above Wells Fargo's weight. The Charlotte-based bank earned $6.7 billion for its common shareholders in the third quarter, or an 11 percent annualized return on equity. In other words, it lagged its West Coast rival's performance, as it typically does – this time by a percentage point. Yet the two now trade at the same multiple of 1.65 times tangible book value, an implicit valuation premium for BofA. Boss Brian Moynihan's turnaround"
Viewsroom: Europe fights U.S. Big Tech,"Riyadh’s problems are spilling over into tech. Fallout from the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has hit Japan’s SoftBank, whose $100 billion new economy war chest is backed by the Kingdom. Masayoshi Son’s investors are rattled. Certainly, entrepreneurs like Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi will be wary of accepting fresh Vision Fund investments. New capital will be harder to come by too."
UK government turmoil hardens Brexit dilemma,"Is global finance complicit with Saudi Arabian tyranny? Following the alleged assassination of a journalist critical of the kingdom, that’s the question leaders of the world’s biggest banks and investment firms must ask themselves before they fuel up their jets and head to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Davos in the Desert” in just over a week. From a strictly moral perspective, if they believe a scintilla of what has been put forward by Turkish authoritie"
Chinese phenom Pinduoduo has some explaining to do,"“Capitalism in America: A History” tells a great story at pace. Its 450-odd pages are packed with observations about entrepreneurs, organized corporations, robber barons, the benefits businesses can bring societies and their owners and how governments interact with companies. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge of The Economist have penned a lively yarn, replete with quirky and breathtaking details."
Hadas: Fear of fiscal deficits is overdone,"Patisserie Valerie needs to find the cause of its sour dough – and fast. The cream cake chain will go under without fresh cash, and it revealed on Friday its Chief Financial Officer Chris Marsh had been arrested. The crucial issue affecting its chances of new investment is whether the group’s recent impressive operating performance contains the same level of hot air as its freshly baked eclairs."
Brexit compromise confirms Britain’s hard choices,"The founder of Oaktree Capital, with $120 bln of assets, doesn’t see signs of an imminent correction or crisis. But investors, particularly in the credit markets, are acting bullish in ways they’ll inevitably regret when the cycle turns, Marks told Rob Cox earlier in October."
Wall Street can be effective forest-fire fighter,"Blind faith in U.S. stocks may be giving way to the facts on the ground. A slump overnight slowed on Thursday, partly thanks to a tame U.S. inflation report. Yet American equity valuations are high, trade tensions and interest rates are rising, and earnings season is under way. There’s plenty for investors to react to."
Jeff Bezos spreads jobs and disappointment,"Tesla can find a better chairman than James Murdoch. The outgoing chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox is the leading candidate to oversee Elon Musk, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. He’d be a better pick than any of the $44 billion electric-car maker’s other directors. But Musk’s tweet denying the story is a reminder that Tesla and its investors need a strong outsider to keep the boss under control."
U.S. sanctions target Cuba's role in propping up Venezuela government: Mnuchin,"Pret A Manger’s owners are facing lean returns. Two customers died after eating contaminated products from the ubiquitous sandwich chain. That’s bad news for takeover specialist JAB, whose 1.5 billion pound buyout in May derives its force from the scope to expand Pret’s slim margins. The cost of putting things right messes that up. "
"Amid complaints of unwanted touching, Biden jokes he got 'permission' to hug","U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday injected himself into one of the most consequential cases of the current Supreme Court term, saying the nation's 2020 census would be ""meaningless"" without adding a citizenship question to the questionnaire."
Twenty states file motion to block Trump border wall funding: N.Y. attorney general,"BMW has drafted a Chinese JV owner manual for its rivals. The luxury carmaker says it will pay $4.2 billion to take control of its venture with Brilliance China Automotive, making it the first to take advantage of new rules allowing foreign brands to do so. Share weakness has helped it drive a bargain, even if the deal doesn’t close until 2022. Others like Daimler may follow in the slipstream."
EU tech’s unholy alliance takes shape in Lisbon,"Amazon is learning that machines are only as good as the people behind them. The $900 billion e-commerce giant had to shut down a résumé-reviewing computer program early last year after discovering it was prejudiced against women, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Algorithms and artificial intelligence hold promise but are limited by programmers’ own biases."
SoftBank turns to dividends to dial up IPO appeal,"No serious investor would analyse a company by looking only at its liabilities. When it comes to countries, however, money managers tend to pay far more attention to government debt than national wealth. The International Monetary Fund is trying to restore some balance by shining a spotlight on the asset side of the public ledger."
Stan Lee’s legacy is Hollywood’s golden ticket,"SoftBank is in danger of over-WeWorking itself. The Japanese group may invest up to $20 billion for a majority stake in the office-sharing outfit, the Wall Street Journal reports. Such a large holding could end up comprising roughly a fifth of SoftBank's tech-focused Vision Fund. That would be a scary amount of concentration risk, especially for an unproven business model."
SoftBank mobile IPO calls for bullish Mrs Watanabe,"The Dolans are proving they’re better at spinoffs than coaching. The family, which controls the almost $7 billion Madison Square Garden Co, is separating yet another business from its empire. This time it’s cleaving off the New York Knicks and Rangers from the Rockettes. The sports team may win no trophies, but the deal could be a slam dunk for shareholders."
Review: Why too much banking can hurt,"The presidency of the Richmond Fed, whose territory included two top U.S. banks, offered a unique window on the financial crisis. Wachovia needed rescuing and BofA’s deal to buy Merrill Lynch nearly collapsed. Lacker reflects on what went down and where finance is headed."
SoftBank investment lines gets blurrier at edges,"French President Emmanuel Macron is finding it easier to build bridges to investors than to voters. A conference on infrastructure hosted by his finance ministry on Monday featured several pitches for why Paris is the ideal centre to develop and finance such projects. The message resonated with fund managers and bankers, who detect a new dynamism and confidence in the euro zone’s second biggest economy. But Macron is having a harder time selling these good news s"
Viewsroom: Democrats will rattle Wall Street cage,"Hong Kong's political risk is taking a new form. The Chinese territory's leader, Carrie Lam, has made a good start tackling the housing crisis and other parts of her domestic agenda. Public sentiment has improved. With mass protests less likely, she may push for a controversial security law next."
Hadas: Central bankers stuck between two myths,"Monday’s 2018 Nobel economics prize can be looked at in two ways. On the bright side, it is an award for long-term thinking and common sense. Less charitably, Paul Romer and William Nordhaus were rewarded for pushing pointless economic modelling in new directions."
New Tesla chair will have to get tougher,"China’s latest cash boost tees up a stimulus conundrum. The central bank said on Sunday it plans to pump another 1.2 trillion yuan ($175 billion) into the financial system. Despite the debt hangover from its last spree, the country does need to invest more in green technology, healthcare and education. Economically, it has some time to plan spending wisely too. Beijing's haste, however, risks a lot more waste."
China’s abused offshore yuan is scarred for life,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr plans to make public a redacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's nearly 400-page investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 election by mid-April, ""if not sooner,"" he said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday."
Trump says U.S.-China trade deal may be reached in four weeks,"A confident leader calls a vote to resolve a long-running debate. However, his campaign lacks punch. A growing number of voters declare their dissent. As the ballot approaches, the result is too close to call."
FBI investigating Chinese woman's Trump resort visit: sources,"Facebook is late to fighting an existential threat for the second time in its 14-year life. Poor security, low-quality content and excessive advertising are as big a danger to Mark Zuckerberg’s company as the 2012 growth of mobile. Facebook finally appears focused on the threat, but it won’t be as easy to solve via acquisitions and improved apps."
U.S. revokes ICC prosecutor's entry visa over Afghanistan investigation,"Posing a question for a book title is risky because the reader may not care to know the answer. But high-stakes gambling is in the DNA of the man behind “Who is Michael Ovitz?” Ovitz has been Hollywood super-agent, dealmaker, art collector and short-lived heir apparent to the corner office at Walt Disney. The last of these is one reason to tough out more than 350 pages. His time at the Mouse House serves as a cautionary tale of succession planning gone haywire."
Obamacare roots grow too deep to dislodge,"Samsung Electronics is close to maxing out its memory limits. South Korea's $260 billion electronics conglomerate is on track for another quarter of record operating profit. Memory prices will probably peak by year-end, however. Slower earnings growth and the mounting legal woes of Samsung's leaders will test investor patience."
U.S. Democrats have to make best of being spoilers,"Even before Lehman Brothers went belly-up, the U.S. Treasury was hatching a contingency plan. Kashkari was one of the architects of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which plugged some $250 bln into banks. He joins Rob Cox from his current perch running the Minneapolis Fed."
Cloud-software IPO deserves an equivocal “yes”,Trade barriers aren’t the only villain in town. Tensions over tariffs and pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement have dominated recent economic headlines. But Thursday’s triple-whammy of news about cyber hacking gives justified prominence to what may be an even bigger threat to global growth and prosperity.
The Exchange: Pascal Lamy,"When General Electric decided in January 2016 to abandon its headquarters in Connecticut’s leafy suburbs for bustling Boston, the industrial company seemed in the best shape in years. The stock had quadrupled from financial-crisis lows, and GE was worth nearly $300 billion. Jeff Immelt, the chairman and chief executive, was finally putting the dark days to rest by wrapping up the biggest takeover of his tenure, the $11 billion purchase of French power group Als"
Private equity could scratch Nestlé skin-care itch,"Fan Bingbing is starring in a Chinese coming-of-age tax tale. Beijing authorities charged the popular actress a whopping $129 million in fines and overdue taxes for concealing past dues. Her months-long disappearance has been a gripping saga, but also feeds into a bigger story."
Xi enters Shanghai in high-stakes tech IPO race,"Ask almost any resident of London or the San Francisco bay area about the price of housing, and you can expect a diatribe. The most common conclusions are that everything is too expensive and only massive construction can solve the problem. That’s not quite right."
Corporate America leads the country to the polls,"Tesco is sending investors into the arms of smaller grocers. Britain’s biggest supermarket by sales is charging lower prices in its home market to fend off discounters, making it harder to hit operating margin targets. Plans to double down with the launch of a new chain of bargain grocery stores will make the challenge even harder."
Naspers’ Vision Fund-lite carries less baggage,Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter on Friday that Mexico does not act on the basis of threats after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico does not stop illegal immigration.
Brazil’s Bolsonaro gives China electric shock,"China’s Big Brother is getting dragged into the trade war by Donald Trump. Export controls and sanctions are under consideration for companies whose technology helps Beijing monitor Muslim minorities. Despite the surprise of this U.S. administration weighing in on Chinese human rights issues at last, the policy could hit U.S. suppliers and further curb enthusiasm for related Chinese stocks."
Tough U.S. Iran sanctions talk meets oil economics,"India has slammed the brakes on a liquidity crisis. New Delhi’s move on Monday to take charge of IL&FS brings short-term relief: the infrastructure lender had started to default on $13 billion of debt, causing panic. Yet rising interest rates will bring more pain, and the country’s shadow banks are still vulnerable. "
Trump says he recommended Cain for seat on Fed board,"Royal Mail is having a ropey old year. Two weeks after Chairman Peter Long resigned in the wake of investor ire over a golden hello for Chief Executive Rico Back, the delivery service unveiled a profit warning that sent its share price down almost a fifth. The problem for workers and investors alike is that its strategy looks as questionable as its approach to remuneration. "
"Trump says if he decides to set tariffs on Mexico cars, rate would be 25 percent","California has come up with one possible solution to the male, pale and stale problem afflicting boardrooms. A law passed on Sunday requires public companies with headquarters in the Golden State to have at least one woman on their boards from next year. Tougher quotas in Norway have not obviously trickled down to broader groups. But board balance is a valid goal in itself."
Congress to sue to block Trump border wall funding action: Pelosi,Good intentions and realpolitik rarely mix. That may well be the case with proposals from a trio of international bodies that seek to address some of U.S. President Donald Trump’s gripes with the World Trade Organization while providing ways for other countries to liberalize commerce without his signoff.
Review: How banks helped cause the housing crisis,"The chair of U.S. bank regulator FDIC in 2008 recalls how competition and disagreements between watchdogs contributed to the crash. A decade later, despite leaving the industry, she still feels an obligation to warn of the dangers of rolling back some post-crisis reforms."
Barclays endorses status quo with new chair,"Data is the new shared beat for transatlantic antitrust cops. Europe’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager and her U.S. Justice Department counterpart Makan Delrahim worry concentrations of personal information may be used to stifle competition. She has been the tougher one so far, but the common focus could hurt tech giants like Facebook and Alphabet that depend on data for profit."
Macquarie widens gap at home and abroad,Buyout groups often pick up each other’s scraps. Cynics argue that such pass-the-parcel deals mean the sector is out of ideas. BC Partners’ latest transaction shows that they can also be a lucrative way to exploit one of private equity’s perennial weaknesses: managers’ finite investment horizons.
The Exchange: Goldfingers,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is helping Hong Kong’s homebuyers. The city’s banks are pushing up their benchmark rates, the first hike in more than a decade. As tighter U.S. monetary policy feeds into Hong Kong mortgages, flat values look set to fall. That may open a door for younger residents, many of who have been priced out of world’s bubbliest property market, but it could also tax economic activity."
Apple’s pricey strategy carries risk,"Japan is bending without breaking on trade. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe finally agreed to bilateral talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday. He had little choice given how vulnerable his nation’s automakers are to U.S. tariffs. Sticking with the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump abandoned, however, gives the Land of the Rising Sun some leverage."
China trade-secrets case brings sanctions closer,"A former U.S. National Security Agency contractor, portrayed as an eccentric hoarder by his lawyers, pleaded guilty in a Baltimore, Maryland court on Thursday to stealing classified documents in a deal likely to put him in prison for nine years."
Cox: A dead president is revived for wrong reasons,"Tesla shareholders may soon find out what their company is really worth. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing to have Elon Musk removed as both chief executive and board member at the $53 billion electric-car maker, accusing him in a lawsuit on Thursday of making “false and misleading statements” about a plan to take it private. Tesla would be depleted without Musk, but also more rationally valued."
Viewsroom: Europe faces life after Angela Merkel,"Margrethe Vestager has taken on Apple, Facebook and Google as Europe’s antitrust commissioner, leaving behind huge fines and bruised feelings. She talks with John Foley about Silicon Valley’s missteps, Europe’s challenges and what she’s buying on Amazon – her latest target."
Sterling appreciates Brexit deal more than bankers,It suddenly feels like the end of an era in Italian high finance. Financier Vincent Bolloré has unexpectedly quit a shareholder pact that has pulled the strings at Mediobanca – and through it at Italy Inc. – ever since the bank was listed in 1956. The move is a mixed blessing for Chief Executive Alberto Nagel.
BHP atones for past M&A sins,"The United States could borrow some ideas from Europe on data privacy. Executives from Amazon, Apple and Alphabet unit Google, among others, told U.S. senators on Wednesday that a federal privacy law is needed to avoid fragmented state rules."
Trump says China will be buying a lot of product from U.S.,"Donald Trump has discovered Africa. After years of paying scant attention to the continent’s economic development, Washington is trying to counter China’s pervasive influence. Yet doubling financing to poor countries to $60 billion – the same amount Beijing pledged to Africa this month – sounds worryingly Cold War. If a desire to trump his Chinese counterpart, rather than solid financials, is the U.S. president’s main objective, American taxpayers will pay the pr"
Senate panel approves Trump's pick for Interior Dept.,"As the chief executive of Citigroup, Pandit engineered the bank’s rescue and recovery from the crisis ten years ago.

Bitcoin remains a triumph of hope over experience,"One of Asia’s largest pharmaceutical research and testing firms is offering Hong Kong investors a profitable spot of therapy. WuXi AppTec, already listed in Shanghai with a market value of $13 billion, carries out clinical trials and a host of other services for heavyweights like Pfizer and Roche. An overhaul of restrictive mainland rules over recent years to encourage locally developed drugs means business is thriving."
Hadas: Wealth-power is about influence not comfort,"Instagram is Facebook’s golden goose – and it runs a real risk of being smothered. The departure of the photo-sharing app’s founders after six years as part of Mark Zuckerberg’s social network isn’t worrying on its own. But Instagram could suffer if too closely identified with its parent, and right now its growth is one of the $480 billion Facebook’s best features."
Hadas: Wealth-power is about influence not comfort,"For the Vatican, China is basically business as usual. For Google, it is a new frontier forcing compromise. And for almost any enterprise with global ambitions, the People’s Republic makes offers that are nearly impossible to refuse.    The Holy See has been dealing with recalcitrant political regimes for centuries. From the Catholic perspective, one high point of church diplomacy probably came in 1077, when the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV waited three days, bare"

Facebook heads into an earnings pincer movement,"Unilever,  only has itself to blame for a growing shareholder revolt in Britain. Loose ends in its plan to pick Rotterdam over London as its global head office have left the consumer giant vulnerable."
Exclusive: FedEx drops NRA deal by snail-mail,"It’s been a year of media madness. Comcast’s $40 billion lurch for Sky set a new standard for excess. Walt Disney too paid an extravagant sum for parts of Rupert Murdoch’s empire, including a stake in the UK pay-TV group. Selling it would allow CEO Bob Iger to reduce the Magic Kingdom’s debt or add firepower to battle streaming rivals like Netflix."
Khashoggi affair presents economic risk for Egypt,"Britain’s Labour party has come up with a superficially appealing plan to transfer wealth from companies to the people, but really to the government. The opposition party on Monday spelled out proposals to force firms to hand a tenth of their shares to workers. It sounds like a benign form of socialism. Really, it’s a tax hike in disguise."
Wilbur Ross finally picks right fight with China,"Barrick Gold and Randgold are wisely prospecting for M&A riches. The $12 billion Canadian miner led by former Goldman Sachs banker John Thornton is set to unite with its smaller, Africa-focused rival. A deal this big would shake up a sector long cowed by past mistakes."
Angela Merkel exit to polarise Germany and Europe,"Comcast  has overreached in its pursuit of Sky. The U.S. cable giant prevailed over Twenty-First Century Fox  on Saturday, winning a dramatic one-day auction with an offer that values the UK broadcaster at 30.6 billion pounds ($40 billion). For Chief Executive Brian Roberts, it’s a huge bet on overseas growth for a company that cannot get much larger at home."
China's Guinea snub sends bearish iron ore signal,"Jefferies has a half-a-million-dollar question to answer. That’s the average compensation for employees at the Wall Street firm, based on results for the first nine months of its financial year released on Friday. It’s 25 percent more than Goldman Sachs shells out. Jefferies also hands staff more of its revenue yet has paltry returns. After a restructuring of its $7.7 billion listed parent, the gap is more prominent and unsustainable."
U.S. senators want stiff sanctions to deter Russia election meddling,"Cannabis is making cryptocurrencies look lethargic. Share prices of listed producers have rocketed, in some cases faster than bitcoin did last year. Brendan Kennedy, the chief executive of Tilray, which made $21 million of revenue last year, believes his company could be worth $100 billion. He’s half right: a weed producer could get that big. The odds are against it being Tilray."
U.S. House condemns Trump's courtroom efforts to end Obamacare,"Banks were the first institutions to fall in a decade of lost trust. The crisis that reached its climax with the failure of Lehman Brothers a decade ago swept away the notion that financial leaders could be relied upon to safely run their firms. Since then central bankers, politicians and the media have also faced growing public scepticism. The malaise shows no sign of lifting."
Trump will meet with Chinese vice premier on Thursday: White House,"The fallout from American tariffs is hinting at a prolonged trade war. As U.S. companies brace for taxes on another $200 billion of Chinese exports, many say they’re now considering leaving the People’s Republic. That has Beijing wondering if such an exodus is as much a policy aim as the stated motive of intellectual property theft."
RBS sends not-so-subtle warning on hard Brexit,"Buying Merrill Lynch has been a qualified success for Bank of America. The $310 billion mega-lender bought the Thundering Herd essentially over a weekend in the depths of the 2008 crisis for $50 billion. Merrill’s retail brokerage has worked out well. But the M&A and equity franchises, which are about to get a new boss, have faded under the BofA brand."
Hollywood rewrites Hong Kong IPO script,"President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Wednesday directing federal agencies to develop a plan to overhaul the U.S. housing finance system, the White House said."
Amazon’s ad initiative is a useful add-on item,"A robocall infestation may demand a robot solution. Scam calls could make up nearly half U.S. traffic next year, data from call control outfit First Orion suggests, up from under 4 percent last year. Society bears the costs in wasted time and swindles."
Alphabet ad machine aids Tim Cook’s data case,"Aston Martin should lose the go-faster stripes. The UK high-end carmaker’s pricing range for its October market debut, released on Thursday, implies a maximum equity price tag of 5.1 billion pounds. While the manufacturer of James Bond cars has a luxury brand, it’s not yet totally suited to the fastest lane."
Viewsroom: The $230 bln scam rocking Nordic banks,"Meituan Dianping's solid debut offers a recipe for its peers. Shares in the Chinese takeaway-to-taxi group rose as much as 7 percent in their Hong Kong debut on Thursday, taking its value to some $56 billion. That's respectable, after handset-maker Xiaomi’s fumbled start in July. Its sober expectations and big-name cornerstone investors helped restore appetites."
Viewsroom: The $230 bln scam rocking Nordic banks,"The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers 10 years ago justified one standard recommendation for economic policy: If a big financial institution collapses in a heap, be sure to keep money flowing through the economy."
Hadas: Six economic reasons to hate Uber,The popularity of Scandi noir rests on the contrast between the banal surface of Nordic societies and the nefarious activities underneath. An internal report into potential money laundering through Denmark’s largest bank by assets – accompanied by the immediate resignation of appropriately named chief executive Thomas Borgen – has provided the latest must-watch instalment. Danske Bank’s problem is that further unpleasant plot twists lie ahead.
Cox: Saudenfreude over Khashoggi absent from Doha,"A bidding war over Australian offices is providing shareholders with an opportunity to move out. U.S. private equity giant Blackstone and the real estate arm of Canadian pension giant OMERS are fighting over Investa Office Fund, a commercial property group with a A$4 billion ($3 billion) portfolio. They are betting on squeezed supply and yields Down Under that remain compelling by global standards. But the target, a lacklustre performer to date, has already cl"
UBS stoops to conquer,"President Trump’s first National Economic Council director and former Goldman Sachs No. 2 discusses the financial crisis and its aftermath with Gina Chon. He also gives his take on tax cuts and trade, and explains why JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon would make a “phenomenal” president."
China aims rare earth bazooka at trade rivals,"Investors can safely ignore glimmers of hope in the trade war between the United States and China. The latest round of U.S. tariffs on $200 bln of Chinese goods, and Beijing’s response, could have been worse, and that buoyed markets. The S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were all slightly up on Tuesday. Investors are missing the bigger picture, though, which is that there’s little to stop things escalating further.  "
U.S. VP Pence warns Turkey against buying Russian air defenses,"Jamie Dimon has already received his first vote for president of the United States – though it might be a bit premature. Former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn told Breakingviews on Monday that the JPMorgan chief would be “phenomenal” in the White House, adding that running the country is like heading a complex, global firm. Cohn was himself the chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, so he ought to know. "

U.S. Democrat O'Rourke raised $9.4 million in first weeks of campaign,"Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated the ""Green New Deal"" resolution that called for tackling climate change by moving the United States off fossil fuels, while Democrats said the vote was a political stunt on an issue that will rise in importance."
Musk charges Tesla at least one-quarter full,Auto groups are dancing with the tech-giant devil. That should make drivers happier. But Google’s push into software for cars looks eerily similar to its highly successful grab for smartphones.
Climate suit should light fire under Exxon owners,"Chinese startups are bringing mainland volatility to New York markets. Tencent-backed news aggregator Qutoutiao more than doubled on its first day of Nasdaq trading, before tumbling on the second; $9 billion luxury electric-car maker Nio see-sawed almost as much. Small free floats and untested business models are partly to blame, but the erratic behaviour will hurt future debuts."
Barclays rehab a tough act for Deutsche to follow,The senior Democrat on the U.S. House Financial Services Committee recalls the lack of answers that lawmakers had in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Exchange went to Congress to discuss that period and find out her priorities if she takes over the banking committee. 
Xi's tone-deaf southern tour wastes opportunity,Reinsurers are facing a perfect storm of higher losses and lower margins. The answer is likely to be a wave of dealmaking.
Top Trump economic aide sells last of credibility,"Interest rates in China may never have turned negative, as they did in neighbouring Japan. Yet China’s economy has also become distorted by the decade of easy money since the 2008 financial crisis. As in the West, low interest rates in China are responsible for inflating asset prices, misallocating capital, aggravating inequality and undermining financial stability."
Record lottery threatens Silicon Valley self-worth,"The official position of the Federal Reserve is that the subprime crisis of 2008 was largely a consequence of poor financial regulation. There’s an alternative view: That the Fed’s easy-money policy after 2002 created a desperate search for higher-yielding securities. It also encouraged banks to partake in what are known as carry trades, borrowing cheaply in dollars and lending at higher rates both at home and abroad. From this perspective, the catastrophe follow"
The Exchange: Kevin Rudd,"Nordic lenders rightly pride themselves on their best-in-class profitability and rock-solid dividends. The problem for Denmark’s Danske Bank is that it may have to add top-notch money-laundering services, if media reports citing between $30 billion and $150 billion of potentially suspicious transactions processed through its Baltic business are accurate. A report in the Financial Times newspaper that Danske’s boss downplayed earlier warnings will do little to mit"
Kimberly-Clark points to end of long-tenured CEOs,"Electric-car maker Nio shifted quickly into a new gear. On the second day of trading after its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, its shares zoomed up 76 percent. That transforms China’s answer to Teslafrom a carmaker into a tech star."
Breakdown: Libor habit is hard and costly to kick,"Anyone who has held shares in American International Group since the end of 2007 is still nursing a 95 percent stock-price loss. That’s even worse than fellow crisis basket case Citigroup. The insurer is, arguably, finally emerging from a lost decade after receiving a controversial $182 billion U.S. government bailout in 2008. But investors remain wary."
One alternative to tainted Saudi cash: Qatar,"On the day Lehman Brothers went belly-up, Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America. As president of the “Thundering Herd,” Fleming was the architect of that transaction. In conversation with Rob Cox, he defends the deal, reminisces on the crisis and discusses his new venture."
Chicago makes history electing Lori Lightfoot as first black woman mayor,"A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday blocked several laws passed by Republican state lawmakers during a December lame-duck session intended to curb the powers of newly elected Democratic Governor Tony Evers, the second such ruling in the past week."
Trump steps back from Mexico border threat as companies warn of economic fallout,"The Greek philosopher Aristotle attacked the charging of interest on grounds that lenders demanded more money in return than they supplied. This ancient prejudice against interest lingers in the French economist Thomas Piketty’s claim that inequality increases when the return on capital, a quantum which includes the rate of interest, is higher than that of economic growth. Yet the overwhelming evidence from the easy money that followed Lehman Brothers’ demise sho"
Truckers gridlocked at U.S.-Mexico line as border agents moved,"Apple's new innovation is to tap fear as well as greed. The $1 trillion firm’s new watches can detect falls and heart conditions, making them a useful gift for grandma, as well as hypochondriacs everywhere. Meanwhile, aesthetic appeal and better cameras should be enough to convince many users to pay up for an improved phone."
KKR throws autos shareholders into a spin,"Lehman Brothers should not have failed. No, that’s not a criticism of the U.S. government’s refusal to bail out the firm, thus condemning it to file for bankruptcy on Sept. 15 a decade ago. Instead, it’s a recognition of how Chief Executive Dick Fuld and his lieutenants had built a well-run investment bank – until they succumbed to hubris."
China’s tech hub warrants an upgrade from Beijing,Europe wants to give news publishers a helping hand. The dominance of technology companies like Google and Facebook mean its efforts will make little difference.
Saudi turmoil is new twist on old C-suite dilemma,"Beijing’s confused tax messages will strain growth. A major fiscal overhaul should leave China’s workers with extra cash to spend. Companies, however, could find themselves chased to pay into the social safety net. The government says the move won’t increase costs, but the confusion has left officials scrambling."
The Exchange: Stephen Harper,"The economy is like a rubber ball. The harder it hits the ground, the faster it bounces back. That’s what normally happens. After the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Western economies experienced their deepest contraction since the 1930s. Yet their subsequent recovery was decidedly lacklustre. Soon after, the markets witnessed a startling rise in the number of zombie firms – marginal businesses that appear to feed and multiply on an unchanging diet of cheap capital."
Italy tries risky EU gamble on budget,"In 1776, English man of letters Horace Walpole observed a “rage of building everywhere”. At the time, the yield on English government bonds, known as Consols, had fallen sharply and mortgages could be had at 3.5 percent. In the “Wealth of Nations”, published that year, Adam Smith observed that the recent decline in interest had pushed up land prices: “When interest was at ten percent, land was commonly sold for ten or twelve years’ purchase. As the interest rate "
China needs shadow bankers to unclog growth,"The biggest question left unanswered since the great financial crisis erupted 10 years ago is the following: Are some banks too big to fail? It can’t be solved because no major U.S. financial institution has come close to collapsing in the decade that followed Lehman Brothers’ failure. Only a true calamity, the conventional wisdom goes, will test the mettle of watchdogs, central bankers and politicians."
Holding: Company babysitters get deserved spanking,"Deputy heads must roll – such is ING Groep’s new “get tough” message on anti-money laundering. When the Dutch bank announced its 775 million euro settlement with Dutch prosecutors for persistent AML violations on Sept. 4, the bank insisted that any failures were collective and “not attributable to some individual persons”. A week on, finance chief Koos Timmermans is the main casualty of an eye-catching U-turn."

Unilever and Nestlé’s growth tests pricing power,"Barney Frank helped craft the post-crisis rules that put banks back on track. He talks with John Foley about how politics has made the system more fragile, why populism thrived on the right but fizzled on the left, and what it was like to be one of the few openly gay lawmakers."
Trump administration stands behind Fed nominee Moore: aide,"Wall Street brains are mostly stumped by tech dilemmas. Giant opportunities and pay packages lured Imran Khan and other rainmakers to Silicon Valley. Their record is mixed at best at Snap, Alphabet and Twitter. Raising capital is easy, instilling discipline harder, and finding ways to beat dominant rivals nearly impossible."
U.S. State Department engaging with Congress on Trump's Central American aid cutoff,"Two twisted sagas playing out at CBS have come to a neat ending. Longtime CBS boss Les Moonves has stepped down after fresh allegations of sexual assault – while at the same time, a truce between controlling owner Shari Redstone and the $21 billion media firm has ushered in some new checks and balances. A much-needed spell of normality is within the company’s reach."
U.S. Senate Republican leader says closing Mexico border could be catastrophic,"Back in November 2002, Ben Bernanke, then a governor of the Federal Reserve, attended Milton Friedman’s 90th birthday party. In his writings, the legendary monetarist had pinned the Great Depression on policy failures of the American central bank. Bernanke was a keen disciple and apologised to Friedman on behalf of his employer, vowing that the Fed wouldn’t make the same mistake again. Less than six years later, Bernanke found himself at the helm of the Fed on th"
China’s wink at punters hints at intervention,"Europeans often bemoan the lack of home-grown technology groups. Germany’s Wirecard  and Netherlands-based Adyen, whose combined value has soared to 43 billion euros, are notable exceptions. They can justify the hype.    Wirecard passed a symbolic milestone on Wednesday when the company replaced Commerzbank  in Germany’s blue-chip DAX index. The 23 billion euro group is worth more than Deutsche Bank, and trades at 40 times forward EBITDA – roughly double the valu"
Finance makes Apple and Google forced friends,"It’s one step forward, and two steps back for Alibaba. Three days after co-founder Jack Ma told a journalist that he planned to step down, the $420 billion e-commerce group confirmed that Chief Executive Daniel Zhang would succeed him as executive chairman in 2019. That’s laudable forward planning. And yet Monday’s official pronouncement raises as many governance questions as it answers.  "
Guest view: Climate activism nears final frontier,Jack Ma's exit is a teachable moment for China tech. The charismatic former English instructor and co-founder of Alibaba has told the New York Times he plans to retire. But Ma will still wield huge influence at the $420 billion company. Investors will want clarity on who really holds the reins.
Hadas: Beware of the curse of financial markets,"An exhortation to focus on “the economy, stupid” is often credited for helping Bill Clinton win the U.S. presidency in 1992. That approach will not work for mainstream politicians in Sweden, which holds an election on Sunday."
Japanese banks sit quietly pretty in Saudi saga,"British Airways is a test case for how harsh Europe’s new data rules are in practice. The airline said late on Thursday that some customer payment records had been stolen. Companies used to shrug off such attacks. But this breach comes after tough data protection laws were introduced in May. Now that non-compliance means fines, such lapses can hit investors as well as customers."
"Netflix is online video’s Walmart, and its Tiffany","Elliott Management is running out of patience with Hyundai. The U.S. hedge-fund giant says the South Korean conglomerate is not making enough progress with its long-awaited overhaul. The complaint looks justified: the sprawling group has yet to follow up after investors nixed a $9 billion plan in May. With regulators stepping up pressure to reform, it may not be able to stall much longer."
David Solomon has a people challenge,"The U.S. military said it successfully tested a missile defense system to knock down an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile class target on Monday, demonstrating its ability to defend against ICBMs from countries like North Korea."
Saudi fail is fresh win for U.S. banks over Europe,"Over the next few weeks, Breakingviews will publish columns and features, produce a series of podcasts and hold a special live event to mark the 10-year anniversary of the global financial crisis. Some readers may consider this overkill. We beg to differ, for a simple reason: When people forget what went awry in 2008, they risk repeating the errors of the past."
China’s share-backed debt problem is a lasting one,"Britain has taken the plunge. UK energy regulator Ofgem on Thursday outlined how it intends to cap energy consumers’ bills, after both main political parties advocated upper limits on what households pay. The whiff of interventionism warrants nervousness in domestic banks’ boardrooms."
The Exchange: Anshu Jain,"The global fight against sea pollution just got a powerful ally. Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign investment fund said on Wednesday it wanted companies it invests in to explain how they plan to save the ocean from threats of massive plastic littering and overfishing. Unlike a recent spat over the fund’s intended disposal of oil and gas stocks, these good intentions should make headway."
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders against increasing number of Supreme Court justices,"Indonesia's best defence of its currency may be a cool head. A dramatic selloff in emerging markets has pushed the rupiah to its weakest level against the dollar since the 1998 Asian crisis. Policymakers appear rattled, but measured approaches are available."
Disaster aid bill stalls in U.S. Congress over Puerto Rico,Jack Dorsey surprisingly topped Sheryl Sandberg as Big Tech’s best Washington representative. Twitter’s usually dry chief executive seemed more genuine than the polished Facebook No. 2 in his first congressional hearing.
Two Republican attorneys general urge court to uphold Obamacare,"Charles Calomiris has a new twist on his old theory about what’s wrong with banking. Unfortunately, the Columbia Business School professor is not pushing his valuable insight in the right direction. "
Wall Street shows Trump the way on Saudi Arabia,"China's 5G ambitions will cross wires with M&A logic. Beijing might merge state-owned wireless carriers China Unicom and China Telecom to create a $70 billion-plus telco giant – and a market duopoly. Consolidation could accelerate the development of ultra-fast networks, but industrial policy goals will limit the financial benefits."
BofA punches above Wells Fargo’s weight,"In the first of our “Ten Years After” series, Peter Thal Larsen talks to Adam Tooze. The Columbia University history professor joins the dots from the 2008 crash to Brexit and U.S. elections, noting a declining faith in U.S. willingness to be the global lender of last resort."
Riyadh is clouding Masayoshi Son's $100 bln vision,"Nike is putting a politically divisive foot forward. The sneaker group will feature Colin Kaepernick, the first U.S. National Football League player to kneel in protest during the national anthem, in its “Just Do It” 30th anniversary ad campaign. Companies often shy away from politics, but in the commoditized sneaker trade, it’s a risk worth taking."

"Review: Forget robots, capitalism is the future","Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, but left unresolved the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice by undermining the investigations that have dogged his presidency."
Patisserie Valerie fate rests on accounts’ hot air,Newly installed chief executives like to get bad news out of the way early on. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is taking that practice to extremes. The “Ramaphoria” that surrounded his accession six months ago was extinguished on Tuesday when official data showed the economy sunk into recession in the first half of the year. The ruling African National Congress is still destined for election victory next year. But without a solid win Ramaphosa’s grip on t
The Exchange: Howard Marks,"Shanghai's early success with its new oil market is beginning to threaten the duopoly of Brent and WTI. In four months, the yuan-denominated crude futures contract has built a 7 percent share of global crude turnover. Dealing in a state-managed currency remains an issue for investors, and Western traders have yet to really weigh in. But Beijing is on the way to building a credible benchmark."
Markets are finally getting back to basics,"Just because beer is cheap, it doesn’t mean you should drink. Africa has for years been drunk on cheap Chinese credit, a habit that has led to waste and even sovereign default. China is now preaching sobriety, but neither Africa’s borrowers nor their lender are showing much appetite for restraint."
Tesla can find a better chair than James Murdoch,"Familiarity can breed respect in financial markets. Take the case of Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who may be staying at the central bank longer than previously agreed. Continuity would be a comfort to investors facing a host of Brexit-related uncertainties. But it would send a bad signal in the long run."
Pret’s soured image puts fat returns out of reach,"JD.com shareholders just got an abrupt reminder about their investment. Richard Liu, the founder and chief executive of the $45 billion Chinese e-commerce company, was arrested in the United States for alleged sexual misconduct and released. Even if he is cleared – JD says the accusation is “unsubstantiated” – the episode renews questions about corporate governance and the use of legally untested structures."
Trump declares U.S. census 'meaningless' without citizenship question,Delaying a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement is actually a win-win-win. Canada and the United States will keep talking despite missing a Friday deadline to conclude trade talks. Negotiators will need to move quickly to avoid the risk of fresh demands from the next Mexican government. But getting a deal that all sides can sell is more important.
"May 23, 2018, story based on BBC report about Ukrainian president and Trump lawyer Cohen is withdrawn","What if the central character of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” was an unraveling hedge-fund manager on the lam in the era of Donald Trump? Cue Gary Shteyngart’s new novel, “Lake Success.” It’s a morality tale-meets-road trip that any ardent reader – though perhaps not subject - of today’s financial headlines will appreciate."
Ex-U.S. Vice President Biden denies inappropriate conduct over alleged kiss,"Coca-Cola  is paying a highly caffeinated price for a global coffee hit. The American soda giant has joined the battle to satisfy consumers’ thirst for java by paying $5.1 billion for Costa, the world’s second-largest chain of cafes. The deal requires Coke to order up new markets for hot drinks. Investors in seller Whitbread  are the big winners."
BMW writes China JV owner manual for its rivals,"Campbell Soup’s lukewarm sales pitch is begging for a real cook. The $12 billion canned food and snack company is trying to sell its fresh and international brands while stepping up cost cuts on its stagnant core business. It is leaving the door open for a sale, but that’s unlikely to appease activists like Third Point’s Dan Loeb."
Amazon gender-diversity fail shows limits of tech,"Mauricio Macri, the pro-market leader of Latin America’s No. 3 economy, has been doing the right thing for Argentina’s long-term prosperity since coming to power in December 2015.

IMF rightly focuses on left side of public ledger,"Retired Ford assembly plant worker and Donald Trump supporter Henry Thompson was giddy as he listened to a summary of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report on TV at a Dearborn, Michigan, diner on Sunday."
SoftBank in danger of over-WeWorking itself,"The crash cost the U.S. economy $30 trln, put 9 mln people out of work and as many families out of their homes. And it exposed how unprepared bankers, lawmakers and watchdogs were. Here we preview our podcast miniseries interviewing some of the movers and shakers of the time."
The Dolans are better at spinoffs than coaching,"MTN Group is facing another nasty surprise in Nigeria. It’s three years since regulators fined the South African mobile operator $5 billion for failing to cancel dormant accounts. Now the country’s central bank has ordered MTN’s local unit to repay $8.1 billion sent to its parent company since 2007. However the saga plays out, the company’s plan to boost future dividends looks in doubt."
The Exchange: Jeff Lacker,A telecom deal Down Under is dialing up high hopes. TPG Telecom and a Vodafone Hutchison joint venture are uniting to create a A$15 billion ($11 billion) competitor in the cutthroat market. The merger reduces chances of a price war and investors are implying hefty synergies can be achieved. Even rival Telstra may come out ahead.
Macron’s bridges to investors bypass voters,"Puerto Rico’s revival relies on re-establishing the certainty of death and taxes. The island’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, on Tuesday put the official death toll from last year’s Hurricane Maria at 2,975, citing the calculations of an independent study he had commissioned. That’s a 46-fold increase on the initial count of just 64 fatalities. The delay is emblematic of wider problems that are hobbling Puerto Rico’s recovery."
Hong Kong’s political risk takes new form,"Over two decades at General Electric, former Vice Chair Beth Comstock had a window seat on the industrial group’s attempts to adapt to changes in technology and markets. She popped by Times Square to discuss GE, and how she became the company’s most senior female executive."
Hadas: Nobel rewards pointless economic modelling,"Brexit is a risky business. Last week’s publication of contingency plans for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union without a deal is an embarrassing reminder of that fact. Advocates of independence failed to realise that virtually all British foreign trade and transport relies on membership of the EU, or on a comprehensive deal with the bloc."
Beijing’s $175 bln boost raises stimulus conundrum,"Chinese loan officers are finding themselves torn between conflicting policy goals. Beijing wants the country’s commercial banks to help fund infrastructure spending to support cooling growth, but isn’t relaxing a campaign to cut a $290 billion pile of bad debt. They also need to somehow remain profitable. First-half earnings show the pressure is pushing them headlong into consumer lending."
Mueller report on Trump and Russia to be made public by mid-April: Barr,"Add Africa to the locations Theresa May is hoping will help shore up Britain’s post-Brexit future. The prime minister on Tuesday promised to tweak her government’s generous aid budget to open doors for UK companies on the continent of a billion people. The longer-term shift to ""trade not aid” will have to be dramatic if it is to compensate for the setback of severing close ties with the European Union. "
U.S. House Republican says it would be illegal to release full Mueller report,"South Korea's chaebol overhaul is running into economic reality. The country’s competition chief just unveiled new rules to rein in multi-layered conglomerates, in what will be the first rewrite of antitrust rules in nearly four decades. Slowing growth, however, has made the likes of Samsung even more important to the country's jobs plight. That means corporate governance reform probably will wind up weaker than originally anticipated."
Trump threatens closure of U.S.-Mexico border next week to stem asylum surge,Chief Executive Elon Musk’s abortive buyout dalliance has hurt his credibility – and may result in legal and regulatory censure. Getting the $53 billion company back on the road requires its cozy directors to do more of the driving. Breakingviews imagines the advice a consultant might give Tesla’s board.
Unilever bows to corporate version of Brexit revolt,"Democratic U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand delivered a fiery repudiation of U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday at the doorstep of one of his most famous properties, making it clear she will not pull her punches in seeking to replace him."
Facebook is late to fight second existential crisis,A deal between the United States and Mexico is only the start of a tough road to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Now Ottawa will rejoin the talks but hurdles like dispute panels remain. President Donald Trump’s fresh outburst at Canada on Monday will also make it hard to close the pact by the end of this week.
Review: Michael Ovitz’s Hollywood adventure,"China Biologic Products makes a good case for why it should go private. Instead of accepting one of two takeover bids offering hefty premiums, the U.S.-listed manufacturer of plasma products opted for a dilutive share sale at a discount to both. Fuzzy math and poor corporate governance create nothing but bad blood."
Samsung is closer to maxing out memory limits,"John McCain was a financial maverick for a Republican. The Arizona senator, who died on Saturday after battling brain cancer, was famous for his independent streak. His last major contribution in Congress, before his illness forced him to stay close to home, was to help block his party’s push to repeal Obamacare. McCain refused to toe the line on Wall Street, including on reining in firms from Goldman Sachs to Credit Suisse after the financial crisis."
The Exchange: Neel Kashkari,"So Tesla isn't going private after all. Chief Executive Elon Musk has pulled the plug on taking the $55 billion electric-car maker private, the company said late on Friday. The abysmal handling of the half-baked idea caps Musk's long record of overpromising and underdelivering."
Cyber risks deserve top billing more often,"To paraphrase former U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, as Donald Trump goes low, the Federal Reserve goes high. U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell on Friday told the annual Jackson Hole monetary-policy confab that he sees little risk of economic overheating, indicating the Fed will raise interest rates again. The remarks were his first in public since the U.S. president took a swipe at Powell’s policies."
Cox: Wooing of GE is lesson for wannabe Amazon HQs,"South Africa can’t afford to have an enemy in the White House. The U.S. president’s tweet on Wednesday criticizing the country for the killing of white farmers may come to nothing, but if things escalate, South Africa has only a thin line of financial and economic defense."
Fan Bingbing stars in a tax coming-of-age tale,"If history is any guide to the future, Citigroup will be in the middle of whatever financial crisis Wall Street manages to cook up next. Or so say James Freeman and Vern McKinley in “Borrowed Time: Two Centuries of Booms, Busts, and Bailouts at Citi,” a new book examining the $180 billion bank’s troubled past. The institution bailed out in 2008 has suffered repeated failures of over-aggression and lack of foresight, while Uncle Sam’s open wallet has blocked mea"
Hadas: Why houses are not like pigs,"Plumbing is unseen but vital U.S. sanctions against Iran could affect key aspects of the pipework that flushes money around the world. The European Union, which is trying to save a 2015 nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic, is so irked that German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday called for a cross-border payments system independent of the United States. China stands a better chance than Europe of setting one up."
Breakingview - Tesco gives investors reason to shop elsewhere,"The U.S.-China trade war is stumbling on the biggest block. Mid-level talks yielded no clear breakthroughs even as President Donald Trump’s administration prepares duties on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods. The United States wants reforms to industrial policy that would fundamentally alter Beijing’s development model. The Chinese government would struggle to deliver, and is unlikely to try."
"After Trump border threat, Mexico says doesn't act on threats","Britain is trying on its Brexit crash helmet. The UK government will on Aug. 23 reveal the first batch of contingency plans covering what happens if the country exits the European Union next March without a deal. The papers are unlikely to assuage many people’s concerns. What the government won’t say, however, is that it has a trump card."
Trump says he could close border with Mexico to trade,"U.S. members of Congress are expected to receive a letter from Attorney General William Barr within the hour, a Department of Justice official said on Sunday, as lawmakers await a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia."
Trump to host Egypt's Sisi on April 9: White House,"Australia’s ban on Huawei undercuts the “Made in China” agenda. Security and political concerns prompted authorities to block the Shenzhen-based telecom giant from providing supplies to the country’s planned 5G network. It’s a setback for Huawei, but also for Beijing. The world-beating national champions it wants to cultivate are increasingly seen as dangerous arms of the state."
China’s Big Brother drafted into trade war,"Amazon looks set to win the Pentagon’s $10 bln JEDI cloud contract, but Oracle is fighting back. Plus: Is it time for Airbnb to sell its China business? And should Elon Musk be worried about a Chinese Tesla lookalike listing in New York?"
Breakingviews- India stems liquidity crisis with IL&FS rescue,The failure of Saudi Aramco’s $2 trillion initial public offering is more a beginning than an end. On Wednesday Reuters reported that Aramco had called off the deal – which had yet to officially launch – and disbanded its army of investment bankers. They’ve been spared the need to sell an overambitious deal to unwelcoming markets. But there are plenty more Saudi deals to be done that advisers will hope can be more easily executed.
Royal Mail’s strategy gets lost in the post,Smug markets are underestimating Donald Trump’s volatility risk at their peril. The U.S. president renewed his auto-tariff threat after a former campaign chief was convicted of tax fraud and his ex-lawyer implicated him in election-finance abuses as part of a guilty plea. Duties on $500 billion in Chinese imports also loom.
California boardroom gender quota is useful nudge,"The logic of an $83 billion gas mega-merger is quickly deflating. Linde  needs to sell more assets than planned to pull off its tie-up with Praxair, meaning hurried disposals and fewer cost savings. Investors are already treating the deal’s benefits as a load of hot air."
Trump-friendly trade reform is a hard ask,"A Chinese beauty app just revealed an ugly tech reality. Meitu unveiled dismal first-half results, which lopped nearly a fifth off its $2.9 billion market capitalisation. A strategic makeover designed to focus more on social media offered little solace. Stiffer competition and regulatory crackdowns are taking their toll."
The Exchange: Sheila Bair,"Business investment is giving fresh legs to the U.S. economy and its aging bull market. Companies are pouring a big chunk of what they saved from last year’s tax cuts into new plant, equipment and software. That provides welcome momentum – and some insurance against trade troubles."
Data is new beat for transatlantic antitrust cops,"Italy’s latest bond fix idea resembles a covert bailout. The economic spokesman of the ruling League Party, Claudio Borghi, says the euro will collapse unless the European Central Bank limits the gap between euro zone countries’ bond yields, and has suggested 150 basis points as a reasonable maximum. The proposal risks giving big spenders free rein to dodge hard budget decisions."
Buyout pass-the-parcel hands BC Partners a present,"A copper-bottomed BHP can now dig into some tougher matters. The mining titan has reorganised its portfolio and, as full year results unveiled on Tuesday show, repaired its balance sheet. Cash flows are near record levels last seen seven years ago. That means the board and boss Andrew Mackenzie can turn their attention to pricklier strategic issues including whether to stick with oil, gas and potash."
Fed helps Hong Kong homebuyers at owners’ expense,"Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro is rearranging the economy’s deckchairs. A plan he announced on Friday night to devalue the bolivar, peg it to an obscure state-backed cryptocurrency and raise the minimum wage is likely to widen the gaping hole in the OPEC member’s finances."

'Hoarder' pleads guilty in one of biggest breaches of U.S. secrets,"An unusually harsh rebuke for one of its top bond rating agencies highlights China’s growth dilemma. Beijing is cracking down on Dagong Global Credit Rating over cosy corporate ties: the sort of links that have contributed to distorted risk pricing in the People’s Republic for years. Yet regulators are simultaneously leaning on banks to step up support for infrastructure, to help revive flagging growth. China wants both more lending and less risky practices: t"
"U.S. lawmakers grill Trump's Interior Dept pick on oil drilling, ethics","Donald Trump has added new impetus to an old debate about corporate short-termism. The U.S. president took to Twitter on Friday to say that he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to study allowing public companies to report earnings every six months, rather than quarterly."
Trump weighs in on Smollett case as Chicago demands reimbursement,"Resembling Turkey is a problem right now. The lira’s alarming slide has made investors wary of any emerging country that shares too many of the same economic and financial vulnerabilities. The most similar, such as South Africa and Argentina, are already hurting. But even those with a less striking resemblance are vulnerable as capital flows out of riskier markets."
Musk suit could uncover Tesla’s true value,Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's idea of taking the company private faces risks beyond the financial and disclosure-related kind. Saudi Arabia’s help in a buyout could spur national-security scrutiny under the newly expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
The Exchange: Europe’s tech-slayer in chief,The feud between President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump over steel tariffs threatens to turn other emerging markets cold. Breakingviews columnists discuss the global impact of Turkey’s currency meltdown. Plus: A bad bank in China gets whacked by political risk.
Bolloré’s exit leaves Mediobanca exposed,Italy’s deadly bridge disaster will shape the country’s infrastructure fix for better or worse. Shares in toll-road operator Atlantia  have fallen as much as 30 percent since the Genoa viaduct collapsed on Tuesday. The tragedy reinforces the case for more investment. But the costs will depend on the government’s treatment of Benetton family-controlled group.
U.S. data privacy suffers from too many cooks,"President Donald Trump may not like Jeff Bezos, but his Department of Defense gets along great with Amazon. Consultants associated with the $927 billion Seattle juggernaut occupied top positions at the Pentagon ahead of the rollout of a massive cloud contract worth some $10 billion that Amazon looks poised to snag. Rivals complain the requirements were written to favor Bezos’s company. Either way, investors should be prepared for its government business to att"
Trump lands too late to spoil China’s Africa party,"The wedding-industrial complex tries to convince couples to celebrate their nuptials every year with a traditional gift. The quality of each present increases with longevity. In year one it’s just paper for the spouse. After 50 it’s glittering gold, and so on. The same could be said for commemorating financial crises: The further away from the anniversary, the more valuable the lesson to be learned."
The Exchange: Vikram Pandit,"Beijing's sovereign wealth fund could do without the fried chicken. China Investment Corporation may join a bid to take private Yum China, the $14 billion operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell outlets in the People’s Republic, Bloomberg reports. A takeout has merits, but is also a risky distraction for the $940 billion giant. Its mission is to invest the country’s vast foreign exchange holdings abroad – not to dabble in complicated buyouts at home. "
Daimler’s new CEO to drive without steering wheel,"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman risks picking the wrong driver. The kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund already holds nearly 5 percent of Tesla and expressed interest in taking the electric-vehicle innovator private, according to boss Elon Musk. That’d be a dicey way to diversify away from oil."
Chinese pharma R&D mixes up a potent IPO formula,"Two people from Central America seeking asylum in the United States were sent back across the border to Mexico on Thursday, despite their claims that a return to Mexico was too dangerous, as part of the first test of a controversial new Trump administration policy."
Facebook at risk of smothering its golden goose,Turkey’s currency crisis was easy to predict. What is more surprising is how weak the global response has been. The old world financial order is badly missed.
Hadas: China makes offers that cannot be refused,China’s stealth support for housing is looking wobbly. Officials are tweaking a $470 billion program through which the People’s Bank of China effectively provides lenders with cheap loans to upgrade housing in smaller cities. Even a small change to the scheme could cause real estate and stock markets to shudder.
Trump adviser Jared Kushner meets Senate intelligence panel for second time: sources,"Elon Musk has revealed a bit about his mooted buyout of Tesla, and a lot about himself. On Monday he explained why he thinks a $59 billion take-private deal is doable, and claimed that the Saudis want to finance it. But the way he has handled disclosures confirms how ill-suited he is for his public role."
"U.S. offshore drilling proposal not complete, timing unclear: Acting Interior Secretary","Beijing’s ownership is no longer reliable investor insurance. China Huarong Asset Management said on Sunday that its first-half earnings would fall sharply, the latest stumble in an acute crisis triggered by its chairman’s fall from grace. The government, its top stakeholder, seems content to watch the stock collapse. State backing, it seems, now comes with even more fine print."
Factbox: Big Democratic field taking shape for 2020 U.S. presidential race,"After digging itself into a crisis, Turkey will probably find the worst way out. The lira’s alarming slide is fanning concern that the country will struggle to meet external financing needs. President Tayyip Erdogan may soon have to choose between imposing capital controls and seeking help from the International Monetary Fund. Defiant self-sufficiency is more his style."
Unilever has itself to blame for investor revolt,"A fight for big spenders in Macau has made earnings volatile in China's gambling hub. Battle lines are being drawn in the gaudy Cotai Strip, where casinos are pulling out the stops to pull in the punters. The conflict is likely to spread, and could weigh on profit margins."
Comcast $40 bln lunacy gives Disney shot at sanity,"Tesla is getting a lesson in buyout realities. Elon Musk’s stated desire to take the money-losing carmaker private has set Wall Street all atwitter. But Dun & Bradstreet’s $5.4 billion leveraged buyout, announced on Thursday, is a reminder of what it usually takes: a mature, mediocre, profitable firm. That’s a better bet than capital-draining dreams of domination."
UK shares-for-workers plan is appealing but flawed,"CEO Elon Musk’s tweet about wanting to take the company private is causing a stir. Unorthodoxy aside, its volatile boss and weak corporate governance means Tesla is better off the public roads. Plus, Pakistan’s likely new leader Imran Khan will have to go hat in hand to the IMF."
Barrick and Randgold wisely explore M&A riches,"The worm sometimes turns. That could easily be the case for sterling, which has fallen to its lowest in nearly a year against the dollar and the euro. Its latest losses are largely due to growing concern that Britain might suffer a chaotic exit from the European Union. Even a glimmer of hope of a better outcome will spark a scramble to buy pounds."
Comcast overreaches for Sky with $40 bln knockout,"Pinterest is taking a mature approach to stock-market listings. The scrapbooking site founded and run by Ben Silbermann is one of the last social networks to tap the public markets for cash, but may do so through an initial public offering in mid-2019, CNBC reported recently. It’s probably worth $13 billion, a tad more than after a fundraising last year."
Jefferies faces half-a-million-dollar question,"The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is still battling Islamic State at the jihadist group's last pocket at Baghouz in eastern Syria, a spokesman for the SDF said on Twitter on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said the area had been taken."
$100 bln weed company is still in the pipe,China Tower’s flotation shows the price of telecoms dominance. Shares of the infrastructure company opened flat in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The newly listed entity commands a low valuation relative to its Western peers. It’s a keen reminder of the cost of leading the global industry.
Banks were first to fall in decade of lost trust,Elon Musk has set up a new diversion for the electric-car maker he runs. On Tuesday he announced on Twitter he is “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” That’s not as big a long shot as it might sound. But a buyout would have to be short on leverage.
Trump tariffs fallout hints at protracted battle,"After vacillating for years, Facebook, Apple, Alphabet and other Silicon Valley stalwarts finally took the hateful rantings of Alex Jones and Infowars off their platforms. As private companies with standards - they call them “community”, not editorial - to uphold, that’s their right. But their actions, seemingly in concert, raise fresh regulatory and business risks."
Merrill Lynch deal a qualified success for BofA,"Chinese peer-to-peer protests are setting a political trap for regulators. Beijing police on Monday stopped irate investors from converging on the head office of China’s banking regulator to demand compensation for losses from collapsed P2P lenders. Officials are partly responsible for the mess, yet a rescue would reinforce moral hazard."
"Trump requests reform plans for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac",Britain’s currency is jumpier than it might look. Options prices offer investors an easy way to check expectations of how much sterling is expected to move around. The relative calm implied by these measures masks a Brexit levy that only becomes apparent when they are compared with other major exchange rates.
U.S. isolated at U.N. Security Council over Golan decision,"Investors in oil majors have a problem. The need to curb carbon emissions means that sometime in the next few decades demand for fossil fuels could peak, raising the risk that prices collapse and reserves lose their value. Shareholders need to decide whether to ask tougher questions, or carry on as normal."
Democrats pounce as Trump administration ratchets up attack on Obamacare,"Beijing's squeeze on yuan doubters sends a bearish signal. The People's Bank of China has reinstated a rule making it more expensive to short the currency. Policymakers might slow the slide, but the move also telegraphs where they think the yuan is heading. That will encourage outflows and complicate efforts to support economic growth."
Robocall infestation demands robot solution,"Casualties may be the only factor that dissuades President Donald Trump on a trade war. The White House is considering increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent. Big firms like Caterpillar can absorb the cost, but an escalating battle could force smaller businesses to close or fire workers."
Aston Martin IPO makes more sense in middle lane,"There are some wonderful passages in “War and Peace” in which Leo Tolstoy ponders the reasons behind Napoleon’s disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Did this great historic event occur because of the French Emperor’s ambition or his Russian counterpart’s resistance, or because of British intrigue or any one of a myriad number of other factors?"
Meituan IPO shows how to tempt investor appetites,"As poisoned chalices go, being president of Zimbabwe takes some beating. ZANU-PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa was declared the winner of the first presidential elections to be held since Robert Mugabe’s removal in a coup. He will find it harder to prevail over the country’s litany of economic problems."
Hadas: Economists trapped in pre-crisis fogs,"A Wisconsin judge on Thursday blocked legislation passed by Republican lawmakers during a December lame-duck session intended to curb the powers of newly elected Democratic Governor Tony Evers, calling the measures unconstitutionally approved."
Danske mea culpa will only partly calm U.S. wrath,"Heineken has found an honourable way to retreat from China. The Dutch giant on Friday announced plans to hand its business in the People’s Republic to China Resources Beer and take a $3.1 billion stake in the country’s top brewer. Focusing on other Asian countries like Vietnam, where it has more clout, makes sense. Influencing the fortunes of its brand in the world’s largest beer market, however, will be more challenging."
Aussie office bid war offers easy investor exit,That’s what CEO Les Moonves gets if he leaves the U.S. TV network – unless fired for cause. That’s rare in corporate America. But allegations he sexually harassed women put the board on the spot. Plus: Hong Kong battles the Big Apple for IPOs. And China faces a vaccine scandal.
The Exchange: A chat with Gary Cohn,"Usually, a central bank rate rise is a signal that things are going well. The one that Bank of England Governor Mark Carney announced on Thursday has more to do with the problems facing the UK economy."
Investors can ignore glimmers of China trade hope,"The Great Moderation – snicker, snort. Surely, the idea that modern economies have no need for economic cycles was killed off by the great financial crisis of 2008. Like the “end of history” proclaimed after the fall of the Soviet Union, this notion seems to belong in the dictionary of utopian follies."
Gary Cohn too quick to vote for President Dimon,"A falling yuan won’t be enough to save China from tariffs. The United States is ramping up duties once more on imports from the People’s Republic. The yuan’s depreciation against the dollar will cushion the blow, but complex Asian supply chains will ensure it still stings."
Gary Cohn too quick to vote for President Dimon,"Elon Musk has eked out some breathing space for Tesla. The $50 billion electric-car maker burned less cash last quarter. It also started cutting 9 percent of its workforce. Along with producing more Model 3s, the company's volatile chief executive reckons that should turn the company profitable in the second half of the year."
U.S. Senate Republicans defeat Green New Deal resolution,Apple is so nearly there. Becoming the first publicly traded company with a market value of $1 trillion is a tantalizing prospect. But it’s really just a number.
Republicans defeat Green New Deal in U.S. Senate vote Democrats call a stunt,"Europe’s de facto investment banking champion has egg on its face. BNP Paribas may have unofficially usurped hapless Deutsche Bank as Europe’s leading investment bank, but it resorted to blaming a “lacklustre context” in fixed income markets for a 27 percent year-on-year slide in first-half investment banking pre-tax profit. Luckily, boss Jean-Laurent Bonnafé has other irons in the fire."
Democratic presidential candidate Gillibrand releases tax returns in challenge to rivals,"Baidu's core strengthening exercise has been underappreciated. The Chinese search giant delivered 45 percent earnings growth last quarter, having shed distractions like financial services and food delivery. Founder Robin Li's big artificial intelligence plans will take time to mature, and economic headwinds are looming. But applying machine learning to fine-tune its mainstay content business should pay off sooner."
Google’s car deal is hazard light for auto groups,"Privacy is building a wider moat for Apple’s margins. The iPhone maker’s premium prices and fast-growing services continued to power earnings in the latest quarter. Selling hardware rather than advertising once seemed like a weakness. But in the wake of Facebook’s woes, CEO Tim Cook is using data security to buff the brand – and profitability."
Breakingviews- Chinese IPOs bring casino trading to New York,"Mississippi's Republican governor signed one of America's strictest abortion bills on Thursday banning women from obtaining an abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can often occur before a woman even realizes she is pregnant."
The Exchange: Congresswoman Maxine Waters,Tidjane Thiam’s multiyear restructuring ordeal is drawing close to an end. The chief executive of Credit Suisse  saw quarterly earnings roughly double due to its wealth management unit. The bank’s profitability is still less than rival UBS  thanks to an underperforming investment bank. But Thiam should still be able to hit his 10 percent return on equity benchmark next year.
Reinsurers’ lean years will trigger M&A wave,China is showing foreign investors a carrot and a big stick. The commerce ministry on Monday released proposals to ease restrictions on some overseas investment in mainland stocks. That’s a welcome reprieve from trade tensions. But calls to vet buyers for security risks will give officials new clout just as investors have fresh reasons to be concerned.
Chancellor: Lehman’s easy money extends to China,"Sergio Marchionne, who has died at 66, took the driver’s seat at a battered and indebted Fiat in June 2004. Thus began the start of a remarkable turnaround, which he repeated five years later when Fiat took control of Chrysler from the U.S. government."
Chancellor: The carry trade that followed Lehman,"Imran Khan’s economic vision for Pakistan is alluring. The party backed by the country’s former cricket hero and likely new prime minister won the most votes in Wednesday’s election. Khan wants to fight corruption, reform government spending and improve the lives of the poor. Given the demands that are likely to come with any bailout of the $300 billion economy, that’s fanciful."
Markets bet against U.S. leniency over Danske,"Twitter has purged users and shareholders alike. The social network’s efforts to reduce spam, fake users and toxicity shrank active monthly users between March and June. Investors fled as well, sending the shares down 16 percent in early morning trading on Friday. That leaves both the platform and valuation more salubrious."
Nio zooms from carmaker to tech star,"Mohammed bin Salman’s financial engineers are earning their fees. Plans for the Saudi crown prince to spearhead a triumphant listing of domestic oil titan Aramco are on ice, but his advisers have a workaround - Aramco may now create the cash itself by borrowing money and buying a stake in chemicals group SABIC. It’s a clever idea, but no substitute for plan A."
AIG’s lost decade is not yet behind it,"BP is bucking the trend. Oil investors nowadays are sceptical of pricey deals that double down on hydrocarbons. The UK oil major’s $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale assets, announced on Friday, superficially ticks those problematic boxes, but is still worthwhile."
The Exchange: Greg Fleming,"Yum China deserves more than a cheap takeout. Hillhouse Capital is in talks to buy the operator of KFCs, Pizza Huts and Taco Bells in the People’s Republic, The Information news website reported on Thursday, after which the company’s shares rose 15 percent. If successful, the Beijing investment outfit gets a Chinese consumption play pre-packed with Western-style governance, and its technology knowhow could supersize the $14 billion company."
Second Wisconsin judge blocks Republican-backed laws curbing Democratic governor's powers,"Amazon’s growth is leaving the shop behind. Jeff Bezos’s outfit now gets just over half its revenue from its online stores, down from two-thirds two years ago. E-commerce is still growing at a healthy clip, but the businesses Amazon has built around it are expanding far faster and producing much more profit. That makes its valuation a little less crazy."
"U.S. House fails to override Trump veto, upholding border wall emergency","The sudden death of Fiat Chrysler’s CEO has robbed the car industry of one its most colorful – and successful – leaders. Antony Currie, Rob Cox and Lisa Jucca look back over his 14 years at the wheel and discuss what’s on the road ahead for his successor Mike Manley."
McConnell backs push for investigation of Russia probe missteps,"U.S. President Donald Trump will host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House next Monday and Tuesday, the White House said, reaffirming the two leaders' close ties."
Chancellor: “Haves” enriched most from Lehman bust,"The sudden new pessimism surrounding Facebook has overshot reality. Forecasts of reduced growth and margins wiped nearly 20 percent, or about $120 billion, off the social network’s valuation overnight after it reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. That’s an astonishing hit, and one of the largest dollar falls in a company’s market capitalization ever. It’s replacing excessive optimism with undue glumness."
Apple’s new innovation: tap fear as well as greed,"European carmakers need to know whether Donald Trump is a pragmatic dealmaker or a hardcore protectionist ideologue. Even though the U.S. president has seemingly relented on potential auto tariffs following a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, they are still none the wiser."
Lehman is long-term champion in Wall Street hubris,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become a poster child for radical left-wing politics in the United States. The young New York candidate for the House of Representatives has a small army of enthusiastic fans, who last month helped her win the Democratic nomination over an established veteran."
EU arms media with a pea-shooter for Google fight,"Sky shareholders may be unduly worried about a truce. Shares in the pay-TV group are down 2 percent since suitor Comcast last week said it wouldn’t challenge Walt Disney’s bid for most of Twenty-First Century Fox. Yet the Mickey Mouse owner could still prove a nuisance to Comcast in the battle for Sky, to investors’ gain."
Beijing’s confused tax message will strain growth,"Xi Jinping is taking off the trade war gloves. Beijing’s effective veto of chipmaker Qualcomm's $44 billion bid for NXP - by dragging its feet to clear the deal - likely wasn't what President Donald Trump expected when he lifted a ban on China's ZTE earlier this month. But in weaponising monopoly law, President Xi has found a sharp response to U.S. tariffs."
Chancellor: Zombies are Lehman’s dangerous spawn,"European Commission boss Jean-Claude Juncker wouldn’t pitch it this way. But on Wednesday, he and U.S. President Donald Trump essentially revived trade goals dating from the Barack Obama era. The European Union will buy more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas, while U.S. tariffs on steel imports from that region may be eliminated if the parties can agree. Other goals featured in negotiations about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, o"
Chancellor: The mother of all speculative bubbles,"Facebook is showing signs of stranger things. The social network’s stock closed at an all-time high on Wednesday, valuing it at some $630 billion. But then investors found enough to dislike in the company’s second-quarter earnings to bring an after-hours selloff. Yet a cauldron of fake-news scandals and possible regulation is lurking. The news feed could get a lot worse."
Cox: Too-big-to-fail bias just now fading away,"After reading a Breakingviews column in January arguing that Sergio Marchionne’s successor as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles chief executive would struggle to defend the car maker’s lead when he retired, Marchionne fired off an email: “This is considered thinking?” It was the kind of challenge I had come to expect since first interviewing him in 2006."
Banks belatedly realise money laundering is bad,Deutsche Bank’s  actual second-quarter numbers are a reminder that it has a semi-permanent residency in the doghouse. Chief Executive Christian Sewing’s surprise July 16 pre-release of the German bank’s numbers briefly gave the impression of a halt to its decay. The difficulty Deutsche Bank will face in hitting even its lowball 4 percent return on tangible equity by the end of next year is a reality check.
Didi falls way behind Uber on road to IPO,"China Tower’s initial public offering is sending the right signals. The mobile-mast giant has set a fair price range for its Hong Kong IPO, which could raise nearly $9 billion. It has also limited the amount of stock sold to so-called cornerstone investors, attracting more than just friends and family. That’s a refreshing change from the usual way Chinese state-owned entities are dumped in Hong Kong."
U.S. Senate's top Democrat criticizes Trump's pick for Fed seat,"U.S. investigators sought warrants to read Michael Cohen's emails in July 2017, nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, according to documents made public on Tuesday."
House Armed Services chairman denies $1 billion transfer for Trump wall,"Facebook and Twitter want to be like vibrant town squares, bustling with conversation and opinions of all stripes. Instead they look like swampy quagmires, where misinformation and bullying abound. Lawmakers and users are beginning to notice, but advertisers on the two social-media platforms have a higher tolerance for grime."
Ex-Trump campaign aide Papadopoulos says applied for pardon,"Britain has joined the security party. The UK government on Tuesday outlined how it proposes to screen foreign investment in domestic companies to better fend off security threats. While most of the proposed changes seem reasonable, they increase scope for political meddling."
The Exchange: Frank on finance,A fiscal nudge in China betrays some underlying growth jitters. The government is adding corporate tax cuts and other steps to support an economy that seems to be humming along. Bureaucratic tussles that preceded the policy changes suggest speed is as much a priority as rebalancing growth.
Wall Street brains mostly stumped by tech dilemmas,"Europe can’t stop the Alphabet profit machine. Regulators have tried to throw sand in the gears of the internet goliath, but blowout quarterly figures show Google’s parent is in a strong position. Europe will need more than stringent data rules, giant fines, and hearings to slow the company’s growth."
CBS cancels melodrama in favor of steady series,"For oil market watchers, Donald Trump’s bark may be worse than his bite. The U.S. president on Monday responded to robust words from Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani by threatening “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before”. Those threats, however, may not extend to Iran’s oil exports."
Chancellor: The legacy of ultralow interest rates,"China’s pharmaceutical scandals are sullying its healthcare cleanup. Quality control problems at two drug makers have angered politicians and frightened consumers. They come despite an earnest campaign to toughen standards. Big heads will probably roll, but better medicine may result."
Europe’s $50 bln payment upstarts can justify hype,"Sergio Marchionne leaves a massive sweater to fill. Fiat Chrysler's board replaced him as chief executive on Saturday after complications from recent surgery caused his health to deteriorate. His successor, Mike Manley, runs Jeep – the Italian-American automaker's most profitable brand that's also at the core of Fiat's new five-year plan. That ought to provide continuity. But without Marchionne at the wheel, 30 billion-euro Fiat may be a more attractive t"
Jack Ma's exit plan just raises more questions,"A quarterly earnings report without big writedowns represents a victory of sorts for General Electric boss John Flannery. Sure, the U.S. conglomerate’s earnings fell by nearly one-third year-on-year in the three months ended June 30 – but at least the nature of the challenge is now clear."
Jack Ma's next moves will instruct China tech,In September it will be a decade since Lehman Brothers collapsed. While many recall the Wall Street firm’s dramatic failure - and the global crisis it unleashed - few know how it began. A dazzling new production of “The Lehman Trilogy” examines that story through the eyes of its founding siblings and the dynasty they created. It’s America’s economic history distilled into a family drama.
"Sweden election shows it’s not the economy, stupid",Britain’s space industry has taken a big step forward. A plan to create Europe’s first-ever rocket launch pad taps into a commercial desire to send satellites into the Earth’s orbit. The bright spot helps offset the Brexit-related row about the UK’s membership of the European Union’s Galileo satellite-navigation project.
BA is guinea pig for tougher EU data rules,"The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, known as perhaps Congress' most bipartisan panel, is split along party lines over whether Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, sources told Reuters."
Elliott's new Hyundai push will be hard to ignore,"Companies around the world just got a stark reminder about how stretched executives can get. Australian billionaire James Packer has resigned from a whopping 22 directorships after quitting the board of casino operator Crown Resorts for mental health reasons. Campaigns against such so-called “overboarding” are on the rise, especially as evidence suggests returns can suffer."
U.S. military says it conducts successful missile defense test,"Pete Sweeney hits the RISE tech conference in Hong Kong and hears pitches on vegan cryptocurrency, fog computing and big data for shrimp farmers. Trade tensions haven’t dented enthusiasm, but venture capitalists expect a correction to flush the dumb money from the market.  "
Pentagon chief says $1 billion of funding shifted to border wall,"Microsoft needs to become its own activist. The software giant now has more than $50 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Tax changes will boost its hoard even faster. With debt easily manageable, the company ought to boost dividends and buybacks, before pushy investors force it to."
Republicans block U.S. Senate Democrats' move on making Mueller report public,The search firm can easily cover the EU’s $5 bln fine for using its Android phone system to stymie rivals. But the order to stop forcing handset makers to pre-install its software could clip innovation. Plus: Goldman Sachs and Tesla put lackluster corporate governance on show.
Cox: Why we remember the 2008 financial crisis,"Saudi Aramco  has a new way to keep corporate financiers busy. The state-owned oil giant has spent more than two years weighing up what would be the world’s largest ever initial public offering. Now it might buy a stake in petrochemical maker Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. Though it’s not unusual for oil producers to diversify into making oil-based products, the deal would do little to help Saudi Arabia achieve a couple of key objectives."
UK power price caps will give banks jitters,"Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts is swallowing his ego a second time. The controlling owner of the U.S. cable firm decided not to top rival Walt Disney’s $71 billion bid for some assets of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox. He also backed down from an aggressive tilt at the Mouse House 14 years earlier. Given the eye-watering price Disney is paying, Roberts and his shareholders should come out the winners."
Norway’s anti-plastics push has firm foundations,"China's commitment to a stable yuan looks unstable. The currency moved below 6.7 to the dollar this week, a level recently defended by state banks. That reflects a greenback rally and cooling Chinese growth, not the export weapon many investors fear. As Beijing warms to monetary easing, though, lines in the forex sand will blow away quickly."
Indonesia can best defend rupiah by staying calm,The European Commission’s $5 billion fine on Google is the least of parent company Alphabet’s worries. A companion order requiring it to stop forcing handset makers to pre-install its Google search app and Chrome browser may cause much more damage – and curb the firm from expanding in areas like self-driving cars.
Jack Dorsey tops Sheryl Sandberg as tech’s DC rep,"James Gorman has greeted the new boss at Goldman Sachs by showing him a clean pair of heels. Morgan Stanley’s chief executive beat his own earnings target again in the latest quarter – and his downtown rival’s returns, too, after stripping out surprisingly lower pay. It’s yet more confirmation that Gorman has built a strong business worthy of commanding a higher multiple than its old adversary."
Hadas: The paradox of risk-free finance,"It’s time for governments to accept a basic truth of the 21st century political economy: Children are an economic drag for parents. Political authorities can take some comfort, however. Low birth rates do not cause serious economic problems."
China 5G ambitions cross wires with M&A logic,"Beto O'Rourke raised more than $6.1 million within 24 hours of announcing his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign said on Monday, highlighting his fundraising prowess in a crowded field."
The Exchange: From slump to Trump,"Forget autonomous driving: The latest digital buzzword is medtech. Investors at last week’s annual RISE technology conference in Hong Kong talked up a coming healthcare artificial-intelligence revolution, and the hype is as palpable in Silicon Valley. Chinese firms are well positioned to take the lead."
Nike puts politically divisive spring in its step,"Investors are betting the fake-news swamp is left undrained. U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday grilled executives from Facebook, YouTube and Twitter about how they filter an ocean of content. Both the politicians’ questions and the company’s answers made any plausible bias-free approach seem remote. And the companies’ rising stocks suggest confidence that no serious regulation will follow."
Guest view: Italy’s autumn of discontent,Symbolism can sometimes be overwhelmed by sheer financial power. That is the unfortunate fate of the trade deal the European Union and Japan signed on Tuesday. The accord between countries which account for nearly a third of the world’s GDP will create the world’s largest open economic area. It’s also a welcome reminder that trade barriers can fall as well as rise. But the benefits are dwarfed by the damage U.S. President Donald Trump could inflict with more tari
Mueller finds no Trump-Russia conspiracy but some questions left unresolved,"Pinduoduo has a long last mile ahead of it. The unprofitable Chinese shopping app wants a valuation of some $20 billion in its upcoming initial public offering in New York. Sales are surging, but its social-networking e-commerce business model targeting consumers in far-flung areas of the People’s Republic could befuddle overseas investors."
Mueller said three weeks ago he wouldn't reach decision on obstruction: Justice official,"Pinduoduo has a long last mile ahead of it. The unprofitable Chinese shopping app wants a valuation of some $20 billion in its upcoming initial public offering in New York. Sales are surging, but its social-networking e-commerce business model targeting consumers in far-flung areas of the People’s Republic could befuddle overseas investors."
Explainer: Why an obstruction case against Trump was so difficult,"Elon Musk has put the board of Tesla on the spot. The $52 billion electric-car maker’s chief executive on Sunday sent a tweet suggesting, without evidence, that one of the men involved in rescuing 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from flooded caves was a pedophile. Such a gratuitous and potentially libelous act deserves punishment. The trouble is, Tesla’s directors may be reluctant to mete it out."
South Africa slump comes at worst possible time,"Netflix's growth stumble is a small gift to rivals. The streaming-video service attracted fewer subscribers than forecast in the second quarter, knocking more than $20 billion off its value. That will comfort Walt Disney and Comcast as they wage a costly battle for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky. Yet even a more sluggish Netflix remains far ahead in the race."
Shanghai's early market win threatens oil duopoly,Goldman Sachs is playing follow-someone-else’s leader. The $87 billion Wall Street firm is expected to announce early this week a career investment banker as its next chief executive. David Solomon comes from the side of Goldman that advises clients rather than the bit that trades securities and produced current chief Lloyd Blankfein. It further de-emphasizes the role that part of the business plays. It’s also something Morgan Stanley did almost a decade ag
China and Africa struggle to kick debt habit,"Three cheers for Deutsche Bank! The embattled German lender on Monday produced a rare positive surprise: second-quarter results weren’t quite as atrocious as analysts had feared. The fact that boss Christian Sewing pushed through deeper cost cuts without revenue plummeting suggests Germany’s largest lender has reached a nadir. However, despite an 8 percent jump in Deutsche’s share price, investors shouldn’t get too excited: a slump in trading revenue augurs plent"
Britain is making a mess of replacing Mark Carney,"One of the most boring numbers in economics just got interesting again. Chinese output grew at 6.7 percent in the second quarter, down a tick from earlier this year. The number has been uncannily, and implausibly, steady, making it all too easy for international investors to shrug off. A trade war and debt management campaigns mean they should start paying closer attention."
JD CEO's arrest steps on governance landmine,Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker all but guaranteed at a campaign event on Friday that he will pick a woman as his running mate if he wins his party’s nomination for president next year.
Delaying NAFTA deal is actually a win-win-win,"The big American banks get ever bigger, more profitable and more cozy. JPMorgan set the tone on Friday with a record $8.3 billion of earnings for the three months ending June 30. Return on equity at Jamie Dimon’s $363 billion colossus was a roomy 14 percent. Citigroup followed with $4.5 billion of earnings for the quarter, comfortably above consensus forecasts. Yet the largest lenders' price-to-earnings multiples have fallen this year even as forecasts of their"
Review: Barry Cohen is a hedge-fund Frankenstein,AT&T has unintentionally thrown a bone to the U.S. antitrust watchdog. The Justice Department faces high hurdles in appealing a harsh ruling that cleared the telecom group’s $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. But AT&T may be a little too complacent: it raised some customer prices.
Coca-Cola pays big price for global coffee fix,"It has not been Theresa May’s week. Having corralled her cabinet into agreement on a softened Brexit strategy last weekend, two senior ministers noisily quit. Then on Thursday Donald Trump overshadowed the early pageantry of his visit to the United Kingdom with an interview in the Sun newspaper. The U.S. president tore into the British prime minister’s plans for leaving the European Union and praised Boris Johnson, one of the ministers who resigned, among much el"
Campbell lukewarm sale pitch is begging for a cook,"Sovereign wealth investors are sounding the alarm. Singapore’s GIC said on Friday it had reduced its exposure to developed markets and was holding more cash, as trade ructions, tighter interest rates and stretched valuations give it pause. Compatriot Temasek and China Investment Corp have also struck notes of caution in recent days. The message is clear: modest returns are on the horizon. "
Virtuous Macri circle turns vicious for Argentina,"Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has used up eight of his nine lives. With a single deal – the $19 billion acquisition of software company CA – he has torched a reputation slowly built through years of savvy acquisitions. Recovering from that will take time, luck and abstinence."
"Republican delight, Democrat dismay as Mueller details released",The price tag for Twenty-First Century Fox assets keeps increasing as Walt Disney and Comcast fight for bits of Rupert Murdoch’s empire. Yet one number just gets smaller: the return on investment for whoever wins.
Mueller report is blow to U.S. Democrats' plans to probe Trump,"When it comes to free speech, Brett Kavanaugh is all business. President Donald Trump’s pick for the U.S. Supreme Court has favored allowing public companies to cut back on disclosure, internet service providers to discriminate against certain content and cable companies to block rivals’ programming. It’s a First Amendment message that investors and consumers probably won’t want to hear."
Russia calls on U.S. to formally recognize there was no collusion,"The U.S. president has chosen a friend of big business in Brett Kavanaugh. But he faces bigger questions from Senate democrats about executive power. Plus: Commodity giant Glencore faces mounting risks in Washington, and what’s behind the Chinese yuan’s downward slide."
"Viewsroom: The financial crisis, 10 years on","Theresa May is belatedly having to confront the contradictions of her Brexit policy. The prime minister’s long-awaited plan for leaving the European Union involves Britain sticking to the bloc’s rules for goods in return for symbolic but uncertain benefits on immigration and trade. Even if Brussels accepts the convoluted arrangement, UK parliamentarians may not."
Nigerian problems cast doubt over MTN payout,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the UK will include a dinner at Blenheim Palace on Thursday with business leaders. Corporate bosses stateside have achieved mixed results – from public praise to Twitter blowback – after public appearances with Trump. Breakingviews offers some advice to the bosses of BP, Shell, Barclays and other domestic peers invited to attend the event."
Australia’s $11 bln telco deal dials up high hopes,"The U.S. Senate on Thursday rebuked President Donald Trump by voting to end his border emergency declaration, as 12 Republicans joined Democrats to deliver a second blow in as many days to the president, who quickly pledged a veto."
Puerto Rico revival needs death-and-tax certainty,"Tiger Global is helping SoftBank narrow its conglomerate discount. Chase Coleman’s hedge fund has built a more than $1 billion stake in the Japanese group, Reuters reported. That should help shrink the gap between what Masayoshi Son thinks his company is worth and its current market value. But valuing SoftBank’s Vision Fund, with stakes in a hodgepodge of startups, is still too complicated."
The Exchange: Beth Comstock,"Sports fans consider the World Cup to be a showcase of bitter competitive rivalry. Passions run so high that the soccer championship sometimes seems like a substitute for war. Yet the matches are basically peaceful. Moreover, the ritual conflicts are merely the visible surface of a great structure built on strong and deep foundations of cooperation. This combination of sharing and fighting has a parallel in the economy – competitive markets."
Hadas: The missed opportunity to do Brexit right,"Enter the trade war corporate welfare state. As China and the United States ratchet up tariffs, politicians are trying to reassure anxious executives with talk of targeted exemptions and subsidies. That just leads to unhealthy and lasting government influence over industry."
China’s bankers have one too many balls in the air,"America’s ""Back to the Future"" trade war lacks Ronald Reagan’s vision. President Donald Trump is using 1980s tactics to hit China with tariffs. The Gipper did the same thing to curb Japanese chips, computers and TVs. But Reagan also helped kick off global talks that created the World Trade Organization."
UK-Africa trade is tiny plaster for Brexit wounds,Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox may be about to push the bidding war for Sky into crazy territory. A mooted new 25 billion pound bid is too high for a buyer to make a decent return. That’s mostly a problem for Fox suitor Walt Disney. 
Korean chaebol overhaul runs into economic reality,"President Donald Trump has given a deregulatory gift to business with his nominee for the Supreme Court. As a federal judge, Brett Kavanaugh has ruled against the Consumer Financial Protection Board and net neutrality. His staunch conservatism ensures stiff Democratic resistance. But if Republican numbers prevail, he can tilt the judicial balance to the right for a generation."
Tesla recharge rests in board’s hands,The departure of two senior government ministers in less than 24 hours will either make or break Prime Minister Theresa May and her Brexit negotiations. It certainly makes the pound a more binary bet for investors.
Democrat Gillibrand calls Trump 'coward' as she launches 2020 bid outside his NY hotel,Fans of England’s soccer team are used to reflecting on what might have been following decades of national disappointment. Such regret is only just beginning for London’s financial services industry. The news that BlackRock has chosen to establish its European alternative investment business in Paris rather than the British capital indicates that one of the big costs of leaving the European Union will be those new businesses which will simply pass the City by.
Republican leader McConnell welcomes more information on Russia probe,"Theresa May’s Brexit plan faces a battle on three fronts. The resignation of cabinet minister David Davis on Sunday night will embolden hardliners in her party who say the Prime Minister’s proposal to quit the European Union is too soft. But opposition parties still think it’s too hard, and Brussels is bound to want more concessions. With less than nine months to go until Britain leaves the bloc, it’s getting harder to envisage a compromise."
Trump legal team says Mueller report totally vindicates president,Xiaomi’s lacklustre initial public offering will punish bankers twice. The Chinese smartphone- maker’s shares opened below the issue price in their $54 billion debut in Hong Kong on Monday. The Beijing-based company’s advisers failed to sufficiently lower an unrealistic valuation target. Their punishment could be that other large listings in the Fragrant Harbour are delayed. 
U.S.-Mexico deal is only start of tough NAFTA road,"Former U.S. Senator Birch Bayh, who authored a landmark 1972 law mandating equal opportunities for women in education and sports and wrote constitutional amendments on lowering the voting age and presidential disability, died on Thursday at the age of 91."
China Biologic suffers contaminated infusion,"The U.S.-China trade war will be fought in the trenches, and it’s going to get ugly. The first round of tariffs hits on Friday, and U.S. President Donald Trump says they might come to cover more than $500 billion of goods. Exporters will feel the pain first, but uncertainty will also dampen investment, impede research and twist reform. It marks a moment of mourning for those who hoped the world’s two largest economies could work things out."
"For a Republican, McCain was a financial maverick","Economic reality is intruding on the political debate over Brexit. Two years after Britain voted to quit the European Union – and nine months before it is formally due to leave the bloc – the terms of its departure remain undecided. Prime Minister Theresa May’s latest plan, which she is due to debate with her cabinet on Friday, will not give companies the clarity they seek. It’s even harder to see how Britain’s financial sector benefits from a supposed “Brexit di"
Musk flip-flop makes job harder to do - and keep,"Donald Trump gives his team too long a leash when it comes to shady behavior. Scott Pruitt survived a rash of ethics scandals before finally resigning as head of the U.S. environmental watchdog on Thursday. His departure shows there are limits, but others facing questions, like commerce chief Wilbur Ross, needn’t worry yet: the bar is high."
"As Trump goes low, Fed goes high",U.S. President Donald Trump made his name as a negotiator. Yet investors are reacting cautiously to the idea that he might strike a deal on car tariffs with the European Union. Their prudence is sensible.
South Africa has thin defense against Trump thump,The tech hub is getting squeezed by new policy restrictions amid a looming trade war between the U.S. and China. How is the Valley holding up? Plus: India's state lenders are losing CEOs. Is running these banks into the ground part of the plan?
Review: Citigroup’s 2008 bailout won’t be its last,"The euro is doomed. That claim was first made as soon as a European single currency was officially suggested in 1970. Predictions of disaster have come steadily ever since. The actual appearance of the currency in virtual form in 1999, the euro zone banking crisis that started in 2010, and now a new eurosceptic Italian government have all spurred warnings of inevitable woe."
Anti-dollar push can fly in Beijing but not Berlin,"The fog surrounding Anil Agarwal’s intentions with Anglo American is only slightly thinner. The Indian billionaire is mulling a merger of his resources group Vedanta with the global miner’s South African operations, Indian newspaper Mint reported on Wednesday. He faces an uphill struggle."
U.S.-China trade talks stumble on biggest block,"Chinese markets have much to fear from fear itself. Global angst mostly accounts for a recent 6 percent fall in the yuan against the U.S. dollar. There’s little to dread about tumbling Chinese stocks or an uptick in bond defaults. Patience is not one of President Xi Jinping’s virtues, though, and panicked intervention by frightened officials is a risk."
Britain can limit no-deal Brexit currency crisis,"Glencore's Washington risks are starting to add up. The commodity giant saw as much as $10 billion wiped off its market value on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Justice asked for details of anti-corruption compliance in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. It’s a separate issue to last month’s settlement with U.S-sanctioned businessman Dan Gertler, but both involve annoying Uncle Sam."
U.S. lawmakers expected to receive letter from Attorney General soon,"A U.S. setback for China Mobile could set a precedent. The Chinese telecoms operator’s application to offer international calls from America is likely to be rejected, after seven years mouldering in the Federal Communications Commission's inbox. With a unit of the Commerce Department recommending an FCC veto based on security concerns, a campaign to cramp Beijing's ability to monitor overseas traffic from Chinese companies and individuals could be getting unde"
Mueller does not find Trump campaign knowingly conspired with Russia,Congress plans to scrutinize why the United States waited so many days to ground all Boeing Co 737 MAX jets involved in Sunday's crash in Ethiopia as other countries and airlines acted more quickly.
Kingsbury on No. 1 pick: 'Everything's on the table',"Tesla’s production upshift puts the focus on bigger battles at the $61 billion electric-car maker. Chief Executive Elon Musk had to pull out all the stops to hit his oft-postponed target date for churning out 5,000 Model 3s a week. But it’s an important – and much-needed – victory."
Australia’s Huawei ban undercuts “Made in China”,"Dan Loeb is hitting the limits of constructive activism at Nestlé. A year after disclosing he had taken a stake in the Swiss consumer giant, the activist investor has renewed his call to shake up its business and board. Though his ideas make sense, progress has been slow and the stock has lagged. That suggests a more muscular approach is needed."
Viewsroom: Amazon’s JEDI rebellion,"The European Union’s fudge-making skills have failed to hide the flaws in its recipe. After haggling all night, leaders on Friday struck a deal on migration which managed to satisfy Italy’s new government while giving German Chancellor Angela Merkel something that may placate her conservative Bavarian allies. But the former’s confrontational stance and the domestic weakness of the latter remain worrying fault lines."
Aramco’s failed IPO is a beginning not an end,"Australia's Huawei ban could be an expensive call. Fresh from passing a new law on foreign meddling in its politics, Canberra now looks set to block the Chinese telecom giant from working on its next-generation mobile network. There are valid concerns. But a ban carries costs too: pricier 5G, and a longer route to improved ties with the country’s best export customer."
Smug markets underestimate Trump volatility risk,The U.S. president rejected hard-liners’ calls to ban China investing in sensitive U.S. tech. Yet he’s pushing for tariffs that could cost carmakers $45 bln and is livid Harley-Davidson will no longer make EU-bound bikes in the States. Plus: tapping China’s shale reserves.
Gas mega-merger hubris deflated by regulators,"In the 126 years after Thomas Edison established General Electric, it became too unwieldy to manage effectively, insufficiently accountable to stakeholders and financially undisciplined. New boss John Flannery’s solution is to break GE up, creating “simpler, stronger and more focused” companies from the once-sprawling industrial and financial conglomerate. If GE can do that, why not the United States of America?"
Chinese beauty app reveals ugly tech reality,AC Milan’s UEFA loss is likely to turn into a gain for U.S. hedge fund Elliott. The famed Italian soccer club has been excluded from next year’s Europa League given doubts over its finances. The ban will likely curb attempts by its struggling Chinese owners to swiftly resell the team – but boosts the chances that creditor Elliott ends up taking on the club for a song.
"Investment gives U.S. market, economy fresh legs","Baidu's planned $1 billion share buyback appears neither generous nor wise. Stock markets have been looking a bit rough recently but the internet giant's shares have still outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of the year, and it could have afforded more munificence. At the same time, the clunky search engine wants to reinvent itself as a leader in artificial intelligence and quantum computing, both of which are expensive endeavours. The $85 billion company"
Italy’s bond fix idea resembles covert bailout,"Businesses will cheer the prospect of another conservative on the Supreme Court, but it has a dangerous downside. U.S. President Donald Trump gets to name a replacement for Anthony Kennedy, who said on Wednesday he will retire from the nine-member panel. It’s Trump’s second pick for the Supreme Court – and it could cause lasting damage."
Copper-bottomed BHP can now dig into bigger issues,"As an American political story, the surprise victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a New York Democratic Party primary election is a pretty big deal. But the 28-year-old Puerto Rican woman from the Bronx may have done something even more impressive than win against a better-funded incumbent. She may have discovered, or rediscovered, a key to substantial social and economic change."
Venezuela’s Maduro rearranges economy’s deckchairs,"Republican U.S. Senator Mike Lee will vote for a resolution ending President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency on the southern border, his spokesman said on Wednesday."
Factbox: A scorecard of key players in U.S. special counsel Russia probe,"Britain’s Takeover Panel is in a tricky position. The M&A rule-maker, staffed largely by bankers and lawyers on secondment, said in April that Walt Disney’s bid for Sky shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox requires it to buy out the rest of the British group. If that means Sky is due any price bumps seen by Rupert Murdoch’s group, the usually risk-averse regulator could put fuel on an already hot bidding war."
"Factbox: Guilty pleas, indictments abound in Trump-Russia probe","Take a Lamborghini, a few movie stars and a dash of Bacardi, and infuse it all with the scent of cryptocurrency riches. With this cocktail, Italian film producer Andrea Iervolino hopes to revolutionize the entertainment industry. He’s building a social-media platform to take on the likes of Netflix and Facebook, and has raised $575 million through a private sale of tokens. The money was the easy part."
Factbox: Smoke or fire? Contacts between Trump campaign and Russia,It’s time for a production company recoupling. The question is whether Endemol Shine Group’s suitors see beyond ugly features like a debt-heavy balance sheet. Rival studio ITV’s current hit “Love Island” could help.
Even a cleaner China is tempted by old playbook,"China’s shale gas push is a fully justified insurance policy. The People’s Republic produces a fraction of U.S. output: its fracking spurt started later, terrain is rough and wells deep. Yet fast-improving domestic technology and state support are helping push output up and costs down. With trade tensions rising, Beijing's hedge is worth the effort."
Trump adds new impetus to old short-termism debate,"Tayyip Erdogan has done what all authoritarian leaders want to do – he has won an unfair election. His Sunday victory in Turkey’s presidential ballot, under the new constitution he devised, makes him a near-absolute leader. Of course, he still cannot overpower global financial markets or economic reality. But the economy is a secondary concern to him – as it is to other “will of the people” leaders."
Capital retreat turns light on Turkey lookalikes,"Beijing’s unicorn banker wants to run with the crowd. China Renaissance, a boutique advisory shop run by former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Fan Bao, just unveiled blueprints for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Some of its tech-titan clients such as Meituan Dianping are doing the same. Slow revenue growth and a small bottom line, however, make the mooted valuation look punchy."
Revamped U.S. deal reviews are skid risk for Tesla,Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan can prevail in politics and yet be a flop in financial markets. The strongman won Sunday’s presidential election while his AK Party and its nationalist allies claimed victory in a parliamentary vote. Enhanced powers and a renewed mandate might embolden the Turkish leader to adopt the sort of policies that are anathema to investors.
Viewsroom: Turkey’s financial crisis may spread,"Washington’s trade threats are giving Beijing an excuse to slide back into state bailouts. The latest easing move from the People's Bank of China reduces the amount of funds banks must hold in reserve, effectively releasing $108 billion into the financial system. The liquidity will buttress rattled markets, and should also bring borrowing costs down. Unfortunately, regulators want most of the funds to go towards supporting the conversion of debt owed by ricket"
Italy bridge fallout will shape infrastructure fix,Airbus’ Brexit certainty drive is wishful thinking. The nature of the Franco-German planemaker’s business means that earmarked transition periods after a UK exit could be too short. But its call for clarity on future arrangements will fall on deaf ears.
Amazon Pentagon ties may receive greater scrutiny,"Sino-American trade tensions could hit U.S. stocks from another angle. Chinese state media published commentary this week suggesting that heavyweights doing business in the People’s Republic, including Intel and Caterpillar, may be targeted for retaliation. The ability to flog them financially is constrained by domestic economic realities, but expansion plans could be curbed."
"Cox: When commemorating crises, think 20 not 10","The U.S. Defense Department signed a memo on Tuesday that would enforce limitations on transgender people serving in the military, a policy that has been the subject of court challenges."
Fried chicken risks diverting Beijing state fund,The Magic Kingdom and the cable company are driving up the price for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox in a global M&A battle that throws financial logic out the window. But does it make sense strategically? Plus: India’s cricket league takes a few pages from the NFL playbook.
Tesla is risky vehicle for Saudi reform drive,"Donald Trump has many fans among the world’s great democracies. He has admirers in the parliaments of France, the Netherlands, Germany and Japan. But no government of a developed country has mimicked the U.S. president’s iconoclastic communications style, broken conventions and put forward radical economic, trade and immigration policies like the new Caesars ruling Italy."
U.S. asylum seekers returned to Mexico despite fear claims under policy challenged in court,"Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz invented the modern car. Now the $75 billion German company built on that legacy seems to have invented the trade-war profit warning. The question for investors is whether Daimler’s stance is a responsible attempt to get out in front of the problem, or a “dog ate my homework” distraction from other shortcomings."
"U.S. lawmaker urges FAA, Boeing employees to disclose details on 737 MAX approval","Saudi Arabia’s stock market is joining the big time. Index provider MSCI on June 20 added the kingdom to its emerging markets benchmark. The elevation is well deserved, but a more important catalyst for internationalising its capital market would be listing national oil champion Aramco."
Citizenship question on U.S. Census would cause Hispanic undercount by millions: study,"India will test Xiaomi's two-pronged strategy. The Chinese group is known for selling affordable smartphones but even a scaled-down valuation target for its initial public offering hangs on success in more profitable internet services such as music and video streaming. Xiaomi is rolling these offerings out in its top overseas market, but may struggle to make an impact.  "
Hadas: Turkey shows damage of fading world order,"Walt Disney has hurled magic and moolah to woo the Murdochs. The Mouse House leapfrogged Comcast by raising its offer for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox to $71 billion, including a generous dollop of cash. Disney has room to go higher still. The cable firm may yet go hostile but would be better off focusing its efforts on Sky."
China’s stealth housing support is looking wobbly,"Facing a possible trade tit-for-tat with U.S. President Donald Trump, the European Union has two unpalatable options: keep matching American measures, or extend a hand to defuse tensions. Offering to slash tariffs on auto imports would dent Europe’s pride, but might avert further economic damage."
Musk missive reveals more than he might like,Societies work best if everyone helps out. Two new studies suggest that many big companies in developed economies are shirking. They are taking too much in profit and paying too little in tax.
Political risk creeps into China’s very bad bank,A deal between Dialog Semiconductor and U.S. touchscreen group Synaptics makes sense. The question is whether the British iPhone-chip maker can pull it off.
Turkey fated to pick worst of its bad options,The markets just delivered a stinging reminder about Chinese consumption. Fresh threats by President Donald Trump to apply tariffs on another $200 billion of goods from the People’s Republic sent mainland stocks reeling on Tuesday. They are now trading at their lowest in a year. Bond prices also fell and the yuan posted its sharpest single-day decline against the dollar since January 2017. Local demand has not yet decoupled from global trade.
Macau moguls’ rivalry threatens cost discipline,"Former Vice President Joe Biden teased a possible bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, telling a friendly crowd of union members he may need their support “in a few weeks.”"
Tesla gets a lesson in buyout realities,"By the UK accountancy regulator’s timid standards, criticism that big audit firms “must act swiftly” to improve the quality of their work is a sizeable rebuke. The power to impose larger fines adds extra heft to official censure. Still, it does nothing to solve the fundamental problem in the accounting business: a lack of competition."
Viewsroom: Tesla’s wild and crazy ride,"Immigration has once again become the European Union’s top political challenge. Though fewer people are arriving from Africa and elsewhere than a few years ago, the issue will be central when EU leaders meet next week. A unified approach could help prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2015. The danger is that anti-immigrant sentiment pushes countries like Germany and Italy towards ineffective piecemeal solutions."
Sterling looks ripe for a short sharp bounce,"ZTE is becoming a harder option to price. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker’s future rests in the hands of American politicians. It lost another $1.4 billion in value on Tuesday morning after the U.S. Senate passed a measure that would yank a lifeline thrown by the Trump administration. The company’s fate isn’t sealed yet, though."
Pinterest shapes up for anti-millennial IPO,Virgin Money has turned out to be an acquiescent bride. The UK lender on Monday agreed to wed larger CYBG in a deal worth 1.7 billion pounds. The agreement to create the UK’s sixth-biggest bank by assets comes barely a month after Virgin Money spurned an initial approach. A union may well make sense – but its shareholders are entitled to feel short-changed.
Heavy fighting continues with Islamic State in Syria: SDF official,"Poor Mexico, the saying goes. So far from God, so close to the United States. Not so, says Andrew Selee in his new book “Vanishing Frontiers: The Forces Driving Mexico and the United States Together”. The two countries, which share a 2,000-mile border and a sometimes bloody history, are united by complex, ever-deeper ties that contradict easy prejudice."
Key trade official Willems to leave White House in midst of China talks,"Rolls-Royce investors are keeping their seat belt fastened despite the promise of an increasingly smooth journey. The British plane engine-maker aims to generate 1 pound of free cash flow per share over the mid-term, quadruple this year’s estimate. Despite the bullish new target, shareholders don’t look to be pricing it in fully. A distant horizon and history of one-off costs suggest why."
Why an unbuilt Moscow Trump tower caught Mueller's attention,"Xiaomi's initial public offering escalates the battle of the bourses. The smartphone-maker originally filed to list in Hong Kong. On Thursday, the Beijing-based company said it will sell at least half of its expected $10 billion initial public offering across the border in Shanghai. This is a blow to the former British colony which only recently changed its rules to woo more tech listings."
China Tower debut reveals costs of tech leadership,Carlo Cottarelli talks about how he nearly led a caretaker government after President Sergio Mattarella last month rejected a euroskeptic finance minister put forward by the parties that won March elections. The former IMF economist has some advice for Italy’s new bosses.  
Tesla buyout would need to go short on leverage,The telco firm prevailed against the DOJ and can now legally buy Time Warner for $85 bln. The green light doesn’t mean that regulators will roll over for other deals however. T-Mobile US and Sprint may still be in the crosshairs. Plus: An Australian bank cartel runs into trouble.
Don’t expect tech giants to stifle Alex Jones,"A staggered exit from quantitative easing is the most Mario Draghi can do. The European Central Bank said on Thursday it expected to stop adding to its bond portfolio via purchases of sovereign and corporate debt. But the exit is qualified by caveats, and a pledge to keep rates low. Trade wars and a weak euro zone mean the ECB president has little choice but to keep his options open."
Chinese peer lending protests set political trap,"Russia's top oil producer Rosneft said on Tuesday that U.S. statements that it had violated U.S. sanctions in its Venezuela activities were ""groundless accusations""."
Sterling’s Brexit jitters bigger than they look,"Gaming out a looming M&A fight between Walt Disney and Comcast is a job for John Nash, the game theorist awarded a Nobel Prize for his study of conflict and cooperation. Short of an unlikely truce between the two groups competing for Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, however, shareholders in British broadcaster Sky should benefit."
Oil investors are complacent on climate change,"Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, is cooking up a $25 billion payday for soccer’s governing body and the sport’s top players. However, his financial backers will only make their money back in extra time - if at all."
China's yuan squeeze sends a bearish signal,"China is starting to trade debt for growth. Credit and capital investment are expanding more slowly, as risky behaviour is reined in. For now, Beijing’s economic goals looks safe. But officials will be thinking about creative ways to keep the money taps open."
Only casualties will dissuade Trump on trade war,"The antitrust case against AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner may be over, but the trials of President Donald Trump’s top trustbusters may just be starting. The U.S. Department of Justice’s total loss in court batters the tough but savvy reputation earned years ago under President Barack Obama. Flimsy legal theories flummoxed experts while stalling other possible deals like a Comcast bid for assets of Twenty-First Century Fox. After Tuesday’s court decision, the wa"
Review: The complex causes of the financial crisis,An important ruling by Britain’s Supreme Court on workers’ rights leaves many big questions about the so-called “gig economy” unanswered. The court’s decision that a self-employed plumber is entitled to workers’ rights is ominous for companies like Uber which depend on casual labour. But it offers little new guidance for dealing with technology’s impact on the way people work.
Zimbabwe’s renewal hinges on trio of tricky fixes,"ZTE is back to life, but faces a tough rehab. The Chinese telecommunications company lost nearly $3 billion in market value after its reprieve from a death sentence imposed by the Trump administration. That suggests concerns about a clean management sweep. If, however, ZTE can find decent leadership and stay out of trouble – big ifs, for sure – a 5G rollout holds real promise."
Wisconsin judge blocks Republican-backed laws curbing Democratic governor's powers,"This time AT&T got the law right. A judge cleared the telecom firm’s $85 billion Time Warner purchase, handing the U.S. Department of Justice a comprehensive defeat. It’s a win for Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, but it could come with a winner’s curse."
House Democrats pressure White House on Kushner's use of WhatsApp,"Tesla’s big-ideas man is sweating the small stuff. Chief Executive Elon Musk told employees on Tuesday that the $60 billion electric-car maker will cut 9 percent of its staff, in an acknowledgement that it’s hard to change the world while not being sustainably profitable. It’s more of a signal than an actual maneuver, but it matters, particularly to the financial community Musk has at times alienated."
Trump says he does not mind if public sees Mueller's Russia probe report,"The marriage of politics and finance in Italy regularly produces strange offspring. But a suggestion, floated over the weekend in the country’s most-respected newspaper, of a James Bond-style plot by some big investors to sink Italian financial markets added a new twist. More curious was the theory’s abrupt disappearance by Monday. The episode highlights the degree to which Europe’s most chaos-resilient economy has entered a risky new paradigm with the arrival"
Heineken beats honourable retreat from China,"Donald Trump’s TV diplomacy lacks definition. A meeting between the U.S. president and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday was mostly for the cameras. Getting rid of Kim’s nuclear weapons remains a distant prospect, and their joint statement made no substantive promises. Still, engagement reduces the risk of a ruinous conflict and might even pry open the North’s economy."
Viewsroom: CBS’s $184 mln #MeToo challenge,"The White House on Monday said it wanted Congress to approve legislation to boost U.S. infrastructure by at least $1 trillion, with a ""tight time frame"" to agree a bill to fund repairs of roads, bridges, airports and other projects."
Mark Carney raises rates from position of weakness,"For Xiaomi to dial up a $75 billion valuation requires a bold call. The Chinese company would have to deliver another year of huge growth. Superior profit margins and premium multiples also must be assumed, a Breakingviews calculator shows."
Hadas: The Great Moderation is due for revival,"Success in Singapore this week could have a downside for China. Any breakthrough in Tuesday’s talks between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, after years of nuclear threats, would be an economic win for Seoul and others in the region. The People’s Republic itself may profit from a détente. President Xi Jinping, though, might lose critical negotiating leverage as trade tensions escalate."
Falling yuan alone won’t save China from tariffs,"China's near-$50 billion bid for market calm might backfire. The securities regulator last week approved six new funds that will guarantee demand for a string of big tech listings, while locking up backers' money for three long years. The intention is probably to dampen a frothy market, but there could be unintended consequences: thinly traded stocks that are, in fact, more volatile and fund investors who might end up regretting being trapped."
Elon Musk ekes out Tesla breathing space,"Italy’s new government says it’s not quitting the euro. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, speaking to the parliament that gave him the nod earlier this week, said his administration had no plans to leave the single currency: “We have to reiterate it, leaving the euro has never been considered and it is not being considered.” Not everyone is taking Conte at his word."
Apple both is and isn’t already a $1 trln company,"Running BT is like running a gauntlet. The former UK telecoms monopoly has to appease shareholders on one side and politicians and regulators on the other. Gavin Patterson, the outgoing chief executive, managed neither during a tenure of nearly five years. His successor can make a start by cutting BT’s dividend."
BNP’s targets have bite despite muzzled traders,"Ant Financial’s $14 billion haul epitomises private-capital excess. The eye-popping funding by the Chinese fintech group, unveiled on Friday, cements a $150 billion valuation. It has raised nearly as much as Facebook and General Motors did in their initial public offerings, even with tech valuations cooling and regulatory risks looming for Jack Ma’s firm."
Baidu's core strength exercise is underappreciated,"Despite Facebook’s mounting problems, only a third of independent shareholders refused to reelect Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg to the board. Tesla and Netflix owners tend to follow the leader, too. Yet protest votes are useful. Plus: Chinese stocks make it into the MSCI."
Privacy builds a wider moat for Apple’s margins,"Britain has unearthed a small nugget of Brexit-related good news. Cabinet ministers on Thursday managed to stop squabbling long enough to agree on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland when the UK leaves the European Union. The bad news is that the backstop position is itself confusing, and could well soon be shot down by European negotiators anyway."
Mississippi governor signs 'heartbeat' abortion ban,"Lord Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, reckons Paul Dacre is the greatest UK newspaper editor of his generation. The tabloid’s peer-beating circulation figures since 2000 add weight to that case. A recent deterioration, however, suggest it’s a good time for Dacre to move on."
U.S. government sued for access to auto tariff probe report,"Western investment banks will have to pick their fights in China. In April, Beijing lifted the cap on foreign ownership of securities joint ventures from 49 to 51 percent, and said this would be raised to 100 percent in three years. But it is hardly worth battling local brokers in underwriting new issues or share dealing."
"House panel interviews Sater, holds hearing in Russia probe","President Donald Trump will propose in his fiscal 2020 budget on Monday that the U.S. Congress cut non-defense spending by 5 percent while boosting spending on the military, veterans' healthcare and border security, the White House budget office said on Sunday."
Credit Suisse returns can vault flatfooted traders,Former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gives the U.S. president some credit for his dealings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. But he explains that Donald Trump’s protectionism has enraged China’s leaders and may play into the hands of the country’s own nationalists.
China shows foreign investors carrot and big stick,An expanded Heathrow’s value to the rest of the UK is hazy. Europe’s busiest airport looks set to build a 14 billion pound runway after getting the thumbs-ups from cabinet ministers on Tuesday. Plans to defuse some of the scheme’s more controversial points look harder to fulfil.
Breakingviews e-book - How Sergio Marchionne saved Fiat and Chrysler,"Is it time for Rome to leave the euro in order to take back control of its fiscal policy? Both parties in the new Italian government have been flirting with that idea for some time. The right-wing League has nationalist reasons, while the radical 5-Star Movement has more nihilist motives. Does returning to the lira make any sense?"
Imran Khan’s Pakistan vision is beyond reach,"The European Union often falls short of Brussels’ grand visions. Witness member states’ unease with the free movement of people, and half-hearted attempts at creating a banking union. Telecom regulation is no different. A new set of rules does little to make tangible the so-called “digital single market”."
Twitter purges users and shareholders alike,"Malaysia's 1MDB purges may hurt before they help. The central bank is the latest institution caught in the backlash over the disgraced wealth fund. More heads will roll in the bureaucracy and beyond, creating extra uncertainty just as external pressures mount and fiscal plans shift."
Saudi’s Aramco plan B is too clever by half,"It has been a long time coming, but Apple could soon be worth $1 trillion – and counting. At $943 billion on Monday, the tech giant is close to being the first company to pass that threshold in market capitalization, as Breakingviews predicted seven years ago. Growth has slowed since then, but customers remain loyal and today’s valuation is far from stretched. Apple’s timely focus on data privacy may help it get there."
BP takes worthwhile gamble with shale deal,"It’s not often that Philip Hammond can lose over 2 billion quid and congratulate himself on a job well done. Nevertheless, the famously dour UK chancellor deserves limited abuse for selling a 7.7 percent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland  for 271 pence per share. While that’s well below the 502 pence average price the government paid to rescue the bank during the last financial crisis, he has some reasonable excuses."
Yum China deserves more than a cheap takeout,"An Australian cartel case bodes ill for equity capital markets bankers. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, are likely to face criminal charges over how they handled leftover stock in a 2015 share sale. If authorities succeed, that could inspire foreign peers."
Amazon's growth is leaving the shop behind,"Howard Schultz is finally quitting Starbucks, the company he built into an iconic $80 billion global coffee brand. He’s turning in his corporate email address and planning new ventures – maybe even running for U.S. president. But he stepped away once before and had to return. If he’s to leave Starbucks for good this time, the coffee chain will need ideas that stay fresher for longer."
Viewsroom: Sergio Marchionne’s legacy,"Jean Pierre Mustier can’t be faulted for his ambition. In the middle of a demanding turnaround of UniCredit, the Frenchman has once again raised the idea of merging Italy’s biggest bank by assets with his former employer Société Générale, according to the Financial Times. The much-mooted combination would create a behemoth stretching from France to Russia. But Italy’s radical new government presents a fresh obstacle."
Trump to host Israel's Netanyahu March 25-26: White House,"U.S. Senator Martha McSally, the first female combat pilot in the U.S. Air Force, said on Wednesday she had been raped by a superior officer but did not report it because she blamed herself and did not trust the system."
U.S. lawmaker says tech companies must quickly remove violent content after New Zealand,"The 1MDB scandal could use some closure. As much as $6 billion was allegedly siphoned from the Malaysian sovereign fund, in a trail of corruption extending from Kuala Lumpur to Hollywood. As newly elected Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reexamines the case, it raises the tantalizing prospect that the ringleaders will be held to account."
"Mexican president talks trade, migration with Trump adviser Kushner","John Carreyrou, the author of “Bad Blood,” explains how Elizabeth Holmes used fear and Silicon Valley myth-making to temporarily become a multi-billionaire – and how he exposed that the $9 bln company’s technology didn’t work."
New Facebook pessimism overshoots reality,"The mad men are howling in the wind. A new book examines the advertising world’s uneasy relationship with Facebook, and how Madison Avenue is trying to combat the social network's clout with electronic exchanges and use of data. Author Ken Auletta has written extensively about the media and advertising business, but he struggles to say the obvious: The middlemen don’t have a prayer."
Tariff truce leaves EU carmakers stuck in low gear,Spain can survive its Frankenstein government. A no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has replaced his weak minority administration with one stitched together from a hodgepodge of disparate parties. At least the economy is growing and fresh elections could produce a more stable outcome.
Hadas: U.S. radicals are a fit for EU mainstream,Pity European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. The Swedish former political science lecturer is spearheading the bloc’s response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. Her first step was decisive. Things will get harder if Trump raises the stakes.
Disney can still play hardball with Comcast on Sky,"Toshiba faces an unfamiliar problem: overabundance. The scandal-hit Japanese electronics group is finally poised to close the tortuous, 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) sale of its memory-chip business, meaning it will be flush with cash after years of crisis. Yet large investor payouts – either dividends or buybacks - seem a distant prospect."
Xi takes trade war gloves off by blocking Qualcomm,"Germany may not be the bookies’ clear favorite to lift the trophy. But a data dive into player values, population and other factors predicts the team will emerge victorious. Meanwhile, Italy stages an economic and political comic opera. Plus: Ant Financial’s $10 bln kitty."
Trump and Juncker revive Obama-era trade goals,"On Thursday, a trade standoff turned into the start of a war. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is moving forward with steel and aluminum tariffs on Germany and other exporters. The European Union has threatened tit-for-tat levies against Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon, among other goods.

Investors hit brakes on record-high Facebook,"When a spoiled child misbehaves, neither the wicked youth nor the misguided parents are innocent. The same is true of spendthrift countries and the indulgent foreign creditors on whom they rely for financial support."
Cox: The Agnellis will miss Marchionne most of all,"As China bulls gain momentum, a new breed of bears has awakened, too. Waning concerns about the country’s economy, debt and infrastructure projects were reflected in some of the investment opportunities proposed at Sohn Hong Kong, the annual idea-fest that helps raise money to fight cancer. Scepticism about tech titans, however, suggests a new mindset shift could be underway."

U.S. investigators sought ex-Trump lawyer Cohen's emails months before raids,Martin Sorrell’s exorbitant pay packages at WPP were supposedly justified by the CEO’s intimate knowledge of the advertising business and roster of high-level contacts.

Bernie Sanders hires Beto O'Rourke critic as top aide in 2020 race,"It has been years since a daily email from Gawker graced my inbox. Sometimes I feel my days could be brightened by one of the now-defunct website’s absurd stories, like “How Did a Juggalette End Up Twerking on This Guy's Enormous Belly?” A potential buyer of the brand might revive it out of bankruptcy to focus on positive news. But mostly, the world is a better place without Gawker reporting on the sex lives of public figures, like wrestler Hulk Hogan, and priv"
Trump rejects idea of expanding U.S. Supreme Court,"Alibaba's delivery route is missing a few turns. The e-commerce titan is leading a $1.4 billion investment into China's top courier service, ZTO Express. It's the latest move in a scattershot approach to logistics and it isn't clear how the pieces fit together into a cohesive strategy."
Facebook and Twitter are lucrative quagmires,"Soccer is a simple game, the England striker Gary Lineker once remarked. “Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end the Germans win.” The quip was on the mark four years ago, when Germany beat Argentina to lift the World Cup in Brazil. If hard numbers have any predictive power, it will once again prove correct when the battle for the sport’s ultimate trophy reaches its climax in Russia this summer."
UK seeks awkward balance between M&A and security,"China’s flabby stock market is set for a workout, as inclusion in MSCI’s influential indexes brings extra foreign scrutiny. While some money will simply track the benchmark, active investors will arrive too. That should mean that prices better reflect fundamentals, and bosses feel increased pressure to shape up."
China’s fiscal nudge betrays growth jitters,Political turmoil in Rome has exposed Italy’s euro fault line. President Sergio Mattarella on Sunday rejected a proposed anti-establishment government amid fears it could take the country out of the single currency. New elections will likely push euro membership to the top of the political agenda.
Europe can’t stop Alphabet profit machine,"China would be wise to avoid having cornerstone investors bear too much of the load. Tech stars such as Alibaba may be encouraged to pre-sell shares to underpin listings at home, and Foxconn just did something similar for its initial public offering in Shanghai. The practice can prevent wild stock swings, but also distorts markets.  "
Trump hardball may still become Iran oil softball,"With $1,745-an-hour friends, who needs enemies? Law firm Kirkland & Ellis billed that astronomical amount in the Toys R Us bankruptcy. On Monday it added injury to insult by scoring a U.S. Supreme Court victory against workers’ right to save money by joining together in lawsuits. Even much cheaper firms, though, are often beyond Americans’ means. Ending attorneys’ monopoly on the legal business could bring more affordable justice."
China’s pharma scandals sully healthcare cleanup,"OPEC is changing course. For the past year-and-a-half, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers like Russia have diligently stuck to agreed oil supply cuts.

Key Senate panel split on Trump-Russia collusion: sources,"The new Italian premier's to-do list is full of hot potatoes. Newcomer Giuseppe Conte, a law professor plucked out of obscurity to lead Italy’s first anti-system government, vowed to defend national interests in all quarters in his first public speech on May 23. If confirmed by parliament, he risks immediate conflict with European Union partners on key economic and policy issues."
"Murdoch's new Fox debuts on Nasdaq, names ex-Speaker Paul Ryan to board","The White House is threatening the automotive industry with a scorched-earth gambit. President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to consider a so-called Section 232 investigation on all imports of vehicles and parts. That may well just be his fuel-injected bargaining chip for negotiations with partners in NAFTA, the North American trade pact. If the levies actually happen, though, it would leave domestic and foreign automakers reeli"
Ex-U.S. Attorney Bharara to Trump: don't mess with Manhattan probes,"Talk of Barclays considering a merger with Standard Chartered reveals little about the UK bank except its limited options for boosting returns. Chairman John McFarlane is keen on a combination with the emerging markets lender, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. A deal appears to make little financial sense. But it underscores how little Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley can do in the short term to appease investors."
Aussie tycoon hammers home overboarding message,"The new chairman of Santos is all-in on energy prices staying high. On Tuesday, Australia's second-largest independent gas producer rebuffed suitor Harbour Energy, after nine months and a string of proposals. Chairman Keith Spence's snub of Harbour’s final $10.8 billion bid seems optimistic."
The Exchange: Asia’s bubbly entrepreneurs,"The first significant adjustment to post-crisis U.S. financial regulation, passed on Tuesday, is not going to unleash financial Gomorrah.

Microsoft could use some self-inflicted activism,Italy’s next economy minister is the one for investors to watch. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League have proposed little-known academic Giuseppe Conte to be prime minister of their radical government.

Viewsroom: Europe puts Google in a bind,"Ant Financial walks like a bank and quacks like one, too. As it lines up new investors ready to value it at some $150 billion, the Alibaba-affiliated outfit is flipping the fintech pitch and describing itself instead as techfin. Ant Financial has become part of the fabric of Chinese finance, though. Beijing would be wise to regulate accordingly."

China's commitment to stable yuan looks unstable,"Sony is loudly demonstrating its love of content. On Tuesday, the Japanese electronics and entertainment group said it would buy majority control of EMI Music Publishing.

EU’s $5 bln fine is the least of Google’s worries,"The Roman Catholic Church rarely responds speedily to anything. By its standards, the decade that passed between the 2008 financial crisis and last week’s publication of an official study of finance is the mere blink of an eye. Unfortunately, so little has changed in the interim that the Vatican’s advice, approved by Pope Francis, is as pertinent as ever."
Gorman shows new Goldman CEO clean pair of heels,"Europe’s mammoth new data-protection law tilts the playing field away from big technology groups and towards consumers. In the short term, giants like Facebook and Google may find it easier than smaller companies to get users’ consent to make money from personal information.

Hadas: Global case of baby fever is easily cured,"Silicon Valley is driven by economic power, and the ability to transmute hard science into fortunes.

O'Rourke candidacy asks: Can a moderate white male win the 2020 Democratic primary?,"Citi’s shortcomings on a small Hong Kong IPO offer lessons ahead of a new listings boom. On Thursday, the city’s securities regulator fined the U.S. bank roughly $7 million over the 2009 initial public offering of Real Gold Mining, which turned out to be a real dud. As a wave of biotechnology outfits boasting complex products prepares to list, bankers will have to stay vigilant."
Really Big Data gives China medical AI edge,"About one in three employees at Google, Facebook and Apple is a woman.

Investors bet fake-news swamp is left undrained,"Chinese airlines are ready to rumble. Having freed local carriers to hike fees at home, Beijing will now let them compete on long-hauls to overseas destinations. A price war to serve popular destinations is in the offing, as the Big Three - China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Air China - fight it out.

Elon Musk outburst puts Tesla board on the spot,"Italy’s mooted radical agenda is a recipe for chaos. A leaked government programme drawn up by likely coalition partners the 5-Star Movement and the League says countries should be able to exit the euro zone, alongside other unorthodox measures and spending pledges. The plan promises a confrontation with European Union partners that is not yet reflected in Italy’s relatively low bond yields. "

The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the feds can’t stop states legalizing wagers on basketball and other games, ending a 1992 ban.

The world’s biggest mobile-mast company has filed a prospectus for a Hong Kong float, which Reuters says could raise $10 billion.

Exclusive: Beto O'Rourke belonged to major hacker group as a teenager,"Italy’s impending radical government will be a headache for the European Union. After days of intense talks, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the rightist League are closing in on a joint political programme and will report to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday afternoon.

Few Americans see savings from Trump's tax reform: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"Three terms. There was no shortage of bollygarchs and financiers insisting that India’s Narendra Modi would win re-election to the prime minister’s office twice more after he swept to power in 2014. Now, in the run up to the next general election, the country’s C-suites are more circumspect even about a second run. Executives are grumbling about Modi and wondering if he can hold on.

May at least gains soft-power edge over Trump,"Nearly ninety years ago, economist John Maynard Keynes warned darkly about widespread “technological unemployment” – a condition which would replace human workers faster than it could find new uses for them. Looking at the low and falling jobless rates in large economies like the United States and Britain, it would be easy to assume he was wrong. But there may be an alternative explanation. Maybe jobs didn’t disappear as industry advanced, but just turned to bu"
Sovereign investors sound market alarm,"Zoopla has enticed a new twist on a classic UK property punt. Silver Lake on Friday offered $3 billion for ZPG , owner of the property search firm. The U.S. buyout group’s bet mirrors that of the property speculators that use its target’s website. Leverage makes it look a better deal, but increases the risk if the market tanks."
Broadcom chief uses up eight of his nine lives,"Malaysia has a chance to rebalance its relationship with China. Newly elected Mahathir Mohamad has accused his predecessor of selling out to Beijing, and vows to review investment deals. The country's strategic position and long-standing ties with the People's Republic give him leverage to renegotiate. But the Malaysian economy still needs Chinese support, so the haggle will stay polite."

While the central banker has gone back on his word in the past, he can’t be blamed this time if his message is misunderstood."
Viewsroom: Trump’s Supreme Court pick,"Turkey’s president is pursuing contradictory goals. Tayyip Erdogan wants to support the sagging lira. That would require measures to curb inflation and the current account deficit. However, his efforts to pump-prime growth, especially before June elections, will achieve the exact opposite."
Brexit is confronted with its own contradictions,"Malaysia's 92-year-old comeback kid has everything to prove. Mahathir Mohamad, a former prime minister, has won a bitterly contested election. Hopes for change run high after the first ever opposition victory, but the political shock will rattle markets, as investors fret about growth momentum and future ties with China. The winning alliance will have to move fast, laying out a clear economic agenda and much-needed anti-corruption reform."

Trump vows 'VETO!' after bipartisan Senate rebuke on wall,"European politicians have ways of coping with U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Their options are, however, not very good ones. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – signed between Tehran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States and the European Union in 2015 – made it possible for European firms to work in Iran without getting sanctioned by the United States. Trump’s blunt action reverses"

Senior prosecutor Weissmann to leave U.S. special counsel's team soon,"A public penta-scrum poses a quandary for Fortis Healthcare’s board. Five suitors are vying to invest in the scandal-hit Indian hospital operator, valuing it at up to $1.4 billion. The offers range from minority stakes to a full takeover. Hedge funds may want a quick exit, but as directors meet on Thursday to evaluate proposals, they would do well to remember that the highest bid may not be the best for a business treating the ill."
SoftBank gets some help tinkering with valuation,"Donald Trump just unloaded multiple bullets targeted at America’s foot. The U.S. president said on May 8 he was rescinding support for the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and re-imposing tough sanctions on Iran lifted as part of the 2015 deal with France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia. It’s a heavy and self-defeating price to pay for sticking to an election pledge."
Hadas: World Cup reveals competitive market secret,"Ever since 1633 when Galileo was found guilty of heresy for arguing the earth rotates around the sun, the Catholic Church has gotten a bad rap over its approach to science. So it’s somewhat surprising to see a group of nuns and church officials leading a campaign to harness technology and science to help resolve America’s tragically exceptional level of gun violence."
Trade war corporate welfare queues will get long,"Millennials need help, but not necessarily a 10,000 pound cheque. A report released on Tuesday flags the dire outlook for some young Brits.

New Fox bid would take Sky into crazy territory,"Takeda Pharmaceutical is swallowing a big dose of risk to buy Shire. The Japanese drugmaker finally struck a deal to take control of its Irish peer, for $62 billion. It can just about make the math work, but requires big spending cuts and a load of debt."
Trump's court pick a deregulatory gift to business,"Higher rates are likely to calm Hong Kong’s frothy property market. Interbank lending is getting more expensive after a decade-long slump, pointing to costlier mortgages and slower price growth. This will be manageable for banks and developers, and welcome for renters and retailers."
Boris Johnson exit makes UK pound more binary bet,"Nestlé is getting a welcome jolt from Starbucks. On Monday, the Swiss food giant said it would pay $7.2 billion for the perpetual right to sell Starbucks-branded coffee pods, beans and so on.

May's Brexit plan faces battle on three fronts,"The 40,000 shareholders crowding Omaha’s CenturyLink Center for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday didn’t come to hear about machine learning or smart beta. They’re here for Chairman Warren Buffett’s plain-speak – and maybe some See’s Candies peanut brittle. That’s probably fine for now. But the idea of a robo-version of the Oracle of Omaha is no longer a ridiculous notion."

U.S. senators say Pentagon budget plan would use 'slush fund' for Trump border wall,"How much influence should central bankers wield in a democracy? That’s the question Paul Tucker ponders in “Unelected Power: The Quest for Legitimacy in Central Banking and the Regulatory State”. His answer is thoughtful and robust. It also contains some uncomfortable conclusions for monetary authorities, which have emerged from the wreckage of the global financial crisis with enhanced powers. Less clear is whether fractious politics, or the demands of keeping th"

Trump gives his team too long a leash,Dealmaking is breaking records. But more tie-ups are being pulled.

U.S. veto on China Mobile could grow wider,"Chinese telecom operators can ring home with good news. U.S. probes into equipment makers ZTE and Huawei might prompt Beijing to delay or scale back a rollout of next generation wireless technology, known as 5G.

U.S. Congress wants to know why the FAA waited so long to ground Boeing 737 jets,"Apple is bumping up against its iPhone limits. The smartphone market is mature, and soft demand for the $1,000-plus X model suggests the company led by Tim Cook has maxed out on pricing. The company’s just-ended quarter - revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion - shows Apple can still sell a lot of phones and more accessories and services. And a robust balance sheet means it plans to repurchase another $100 billion in shares and increase the dividend. But the "
"Senior Republican, eyeing Trump budget, worries about U.S. debt","Three years ago, Vista Outdoor was brought to life in that manner by which corporations reproduce: a tax-free spinoff to shareholders. Alliant Techsystems, a defense business, set Vista free to be “a standalone, publicly traded outdoor sports and recreation company.” That was a euphemistic way to say Vista sells guns like the AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles used in the mass-shootings that have become all too common in the United States."

Tesla upshift puts focus on bigger battles,"BP’s quest to rejuvenate itself following its 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster has been a marathon – even after $66 billion in pre-tax charges, the UK oil major is likely to have to pay $3 billion in 2018.

Dan Loeb hits limits of “constructivism” on Nestlé,"Memories of Apple nearly going bankrupt in the mid-1990s scared Steve Jobs and his colleagues. Now worth some $840 billion, it has kept an absurdly conservative balance sheet for two decades.

EU immigration deal papers over two big problems,"J Sainsbury will try to succeed where Walmart flopped. The British grocer is buying the U.S. retail giant’s Asda subsidiary for 7.3 billion pounds in cash and stock.

Breakingviews- Australia's ban on Huawei would be a costly call,"Selling Sprint puts SoftBank’s vision into sharper focus. The U.S. wireless carrier agreed to be the junior partner in a deal with larger rival T-Mobile US in an all-stock deal valuing Sprint at $59 billion, including debt. That represents a U-turn for the Japanese parent company's boss, Masayoshi Son, but one which fixes his thorniest problem."
Viewsroom: Trump goes hog wild on trade,"T-Mobile US and Sprint are pitching an America First 5G deal. The mobile operators agreed on Sunday to merge to create a more powerful competitor to market leaders Verizon and AT&T.

Breakingviews- Baidu's $1 bln buyback is too little or too much,"Mark Carney can now procrastinate with impunity. A sharp slowdown in UK growth in the first quarter, announced on Friday, gives the Bank of England governor a good reason to delay raising UK interest rates. A slackening in economic activity in continental Europe makes it practically reckless for him to do anything else at a May 10 policy meeting."
Pro-business Supreme Court has dangerous downside,"Baidu's revival is accelerating China's AI race. Quarterly earnings at China's search giant topped $1 billion, trouncing expectations. Sales at its listed video arm, iQiyi, also jumped. Baidu may have been eclipsed by rivals like Alibaba, yet progress in autonomous driving is giving it an early lead in tech's next battlefield."

The software giant is vying with retailer Amazon to be the planet’s second-biggest firm by market capitalization, at nearly $730 billion. Its secret is dullness and durability: the predictability of Microsoft’s earnings under boss Satya Nadella has helped the firm’s stock outperform Apple, Alphabet and Facebook over the past five years."
Fifth Republican senator will vote to end Trump's border emergency,"Amazon is widening its girth. Jeff Bezos’s firm reported first-quarter revenue grew 43 percent year-over-year. Sales have more than doubled in five years, but it’s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart."
"Federal landlord blames Congress for FBI HQ delay, change","After Deutsche Bank accidentally transferred 28 billion euros to a counterparty a few weeks ago, some joked that the payment was a deferred bonus for former CEO Anshu Jain. Four years after his departure, the German lender is still grappling with the global investment banking business that he championed. New boss Christian Sewing’s plan to scale back equities trading, and make cuts in the United States and Asia, finally lays that vision to rest."
Trump announces news conference at U.S.-Mexico border within three weeks,"A U.S. squeeze could rally China’s tech sector behind Beijing. Like rival ZTE, Chinese telecommunications equipment giant Huawei could be in trouble over sanctions violations. Beijing, which has long dreamt of self-sufficiency in technology, could enlist help from the likes of Alibaba."
Disney-Fox-Sky puts UK M&A regulators in a bind,"Facebook’s future could look like Microsoft’s past. Tumbling valuations and regulatory attacks crushed the shares of Bill Gates’ software juggernaut nearly two decades ago. Mark Zuckerberg’s $463 billion social network is growing fast. That’s no reason, though, to assume that Facebook will be immune to the same kind of risks."
Crypto goes to Hollywood without a happy ending,"Comcast boss Brian Roberts already made a bid for parts of Twenty-First Century Fox, and failed. Now he has left the door ajar for another lurch. It would be better to walk away."
Breakingview - Endemol’s $4 bln sale needs “Love Island” glitter,"Deals rarely look as good on paper as they do in a chief executive’s head. Comcast’s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet."
China’s homegrown shale is worth the bother,"Lawyers for Paul Manafort, U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, asked a federal judge in Virginia on Friday to hand down a sentence that is significantly below sentencing guidelines, according to a court filing."
Hadas: Turkish strongman overcomes mixed economics,"The world is over-indebted. Global debt totals $164 trillion, or 225 percent of the planet’s GDP, say Vitor Gaspar and Laura Jaramillo of the International Monetary Fund. And in case that number isn’t troubling enough, the Institute of International Finance uses different definitions to reach a debt-to-GDP ratio of 318 percent."
Chinese bank IPO seeks to emulate its tech clients,"Call it the curse of high expectations. In mid-February Tidjane Thiam confidently trumpeted the Swiss bank’s “strong start” to “market-dependant activities” – in other words, trading. Back then, the Credit Suisse boss pointed to an estimated year-on-year increase in net revenue for the first six weeks of the year of more than one-tenth, thanks to increased market volatility. Performance must have trailed off – while the picture looks better in U.S. dollar terms, "
Turkey’s strongman gains mandate for bad policies,The Trump administration’s decision to ban U.S. companies from selling to the Chinese telecom giant is seriously hurting the company's business. And there’s no easy plan B for ZTE. Also: China has a new way to measure unemployment. Should investors take it seriously?
Trump gives China a fresh excuse to push bailouts,"Hong Kong’s stock exchange has unveiled rules to host companies with super-voting stock. The system will be great for founders, but not so super for other investors."
Airbus’ Brexit certainty drive is wishful thinking,"Wells Fargo shareholders have given Chief Executive Tim Sloan a welcome respite. Owners overwhelmingly backed executive pay and directors at the $256 billion bank’s at times ill-tempered annual meeting on Tuesday. It’s Sloan’s first good news after a slew of regulatory hits, including last week’s $1 billion fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."
America Inc. may want to revise China growth plans,"The American rethink on Russian sanctions should be more reassuring than it is. The U.S. Treasury said on April 23 that it would give customers more time to comply with tough recent curbs on Rusal, and also offered the group the chance to disentangle itself from owner Oleg Deripaska. That’s good for commodities markets, but only up to a point."
Pentagon sets limits on transgender troops,"An insurgency effort at Hyundai is pushing for too much. U.S. hedge-fund titan Elliott Management wants a different sort of restructuring at South Korea’s second-largest chaebol, or family-owned conglomerate. Limitations on financial subsidiaries mean Hyundai may stick with its original structural overhaul."
"For Manafort's sentencing, a trip to the pre-cellphone era","Google’s owner Alphabet is starting to look like alphabet soup. The tech group’s $9.4 billion of earnings in the first quarter came with new noise after it adjusted the way it accounts for investments like ride-hailing app Uber, moved some smart-home appliances into Google and started stressing “impressions” over clicks. Investors wanting concrete measurements are getting squishy ones instead.    "
Mueller says former Trump adviser Flynn's cooperation 'otherwise complete',"The bond market may be throwing investors a curve ball. The difference between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates is the smallest since before the financial crisis. The possibility of an inversion, when long-term yields fall below short-term rates, has raised recession fears. Yet it’s a flawed indicator."
"Viewsroom: Disney, Comcast go from zero to berserk","UBS has reaffirmed its familiar exalted position in the European bank pecking order. The Swiss lender’s investment bank earned a 24 percent return on equity in the three months to end-March. One driver of its status is management’s decision back in 2012 to cut fixed income trading, which came up trumps. The other is the haplessness of rivals."
Cox: Italy’s new Caesars have outdone Donald Trump,"Republican and Democratic U.S. senators proposed legislation on Thursday that would let an estimated 72,000 Venezuelans remain in the United States after fleeing chaos in their country."
Trade war tariffs eat Daimler’s homework,"Arsène Wenger’s career is instructive in many ways. The studious Frenchman helped revolutionise British soccer following his arrival as Arsenal manager in 1996. His focus on nutrition, precise training and mental discipline produced a golden age of victories for the North London club. As Wenger hangs up his boots after 22 years in charge, however, the main takeaway for corporate leaders is this: don’t hang around too long."
Saudi index win is stepping stone not step change,"Renowned social scientist Robert Putnam was so horrified by his research results that he almost binned them. His vast, meticulous survey, which ended in 2000, found that Americans living in ethnically diverse communities became less trustful than their peers in homogenous neighbourhoods. They not only became sceptical of people from other races, but of their own ethnic group too. Placed in proximity with those from different backgrounds, humans did not become "
India will test Xiaomi's two-pronged strategy,Japan would take a turn for the worse without its chief reformer. Scandals have badly hurt Shinzo Abe; public support for the prime minister since 2012 has fallen to a record low. It looks increasingly likely that he could be forced out of his position. That would weaken an ambitious overhaul of the world's third largest economy. 
Disney hurls magic and moolah to woo Murdoch,Upstarts like LendingClub and SoFi need to find ways to keep customers returning – just as traditional banks are fighting back and Goldman Sachs’ digital push into consumer lending takes off. Also: how Malaysia’s prime minister may be re-elected despite the 1MDB scandal.
EU’s best bet is to indulge Trump on car tariffs,"Buying stuff is not the standard prescription for companies under pressure from activist investors. Procter & Gamble’s 3.4 billion euro splurge on Merck KGaA’s consumer unit, the maker of Seven Seas vitamin pills, will need a booster shot to earn the support of newly appointed board member Nelson Peltz."
Hadas: Irresponsible companies feed bad politics,"Wynn Resorts is tossing three women into an escalating boardroom brawl, adding Betsy Atkins, Dee Dee Myers and Wendy Webb as independent directors. The $21 billion casino giant is trying to move beyond a sex scandal involving founder Steve Wynn. But his ex-wife Elaine Wynn wants a full overhaul. With a battle brewing, the new additions had best come ready to rumble."
Apple supplier’s M&A bite looks too much to chew,"Raul Castro's scheduled handover of Cuba's presidency this week is an effort to prolong the communist revolution he built with his late brother Fidel. Trying to modernize the creaking, incompetent bureaucracy could also destroy their lives' work. Yet with ally Venezuela getting less able to provide cheap oil, economic reform can't wait long."
Market swoon undercuts Chinese consumer tale,China may yet become a world leader in patent protection. That would be the natural result of becoming a world leader in many technologies. But Beijing’s approach to intellectual property may become part of a larger change in the world’s approach to the control of knowledge.
"'Be careful what you wish for,' says Biden, in tease of 2020 presidential bid","Morgan Stanley is lumping its shareholders with a volatility challenge. In the first quarter the $94 billion Wall Street firm defended key turf against a surge from rivals and more than doubled fixed-income trading revenue from the last three months of 2017. That – and tax cuts – helped generate its best results in years, handily beating Chief Executive James Gorman’s admittedly underwhelming targets. The dilemma for investors is whether that merits a higher va"
Appeals court says Ohio may withhold Planned Parenthood funding,China’s game of pass-the-parcel with Rosneft just took a fresh twist. The investigation of state asset manager Huarong’s chairman on graft allegations marks the second time in as many months that an entity interested in acquiring a stake in the Russian oil company has fallen foul of Beijing’s anti-corruption drive. But it’s less problematic for diplomatic relations than it looks.
U.S. immigration agency to close its overseas offices,Investigations involving President Donald Trump by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and U.S. lawmakers have raised the possibility that Congress could seek to remove him from office using the impeachment process set out in the Constitution.
KPMG wrist-slap shows auditors are too few to fail,"China’s new unemployment measure has a big job ahead. In the first regular monthly numbers using surveys, Beijing reported a 5.1 percent jobless rate. It's a far better method than relying on claims of work-seekers. The question is whether officials will trust the gauge enough to scrap GDP growth targets – and if investors and others will trust it in a downturn."
DIY approach weakens Europe’s migration defences,"“Who am I to tell others what ethical leadership is?” With the first line of his much-anticipated memoir, James Comey goes to the heart of his message – but also to the focal point of his many critics. In “A Higher Loyalty,” the ex-FBI director who once prosecuted Martha Stewart and worked at Bridgewater Associates calls U.S. President Donald Trump an unethical liar and a threat to American institutions. Comey’s yarn is riveting, but reveals his flawed mix of p"
ZTE becomes an even cheaper stock option,"Starbucks is setting an example for corporate America with its anti-racism coffee break. Facing a backlash over the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia shop, the chain will shut all of its company-owned U.S. outlets for an afternoon of racial-bias education. The swift response backs up Starbucks’ social goals and offers a lesson to others."
Virgin Money is cheap bride in UK bank wedding,"In a conference room overlooking Victoria Harbour, a senior banker smacked a mahogany table in mock theatricality and caused the tea cup on it to rattle around. Informed that rival HSBC had just anointed a senior executive in Asia with the newly minted role of ""Head of Belt and Road Initiative,"" the financier exclaimed: ""Damn, I wish we had thought of that first."""
Review: The other side of Trumpismo,"A club under the San Francisco freeway is one of the last places you’d expect Goldman Sachs to throw a party. But it’s not investment bankers gathering here. Instead, it’s a comedy show arranged by Marcus, the company’s online retail bank. The unit’s edgier approach to business - and marketing - is giving Goldman a buzz it has sorely lacked."
Rolls-Royce investors wisely keep the seat belt on,"China’s campaign to cut bad debt is at risk of losing resolve. GDP growth in the first quarter held steady at 6.8 percent, but more substantive indicators like industrial activity and inflation suggest some cooling. The central bank’s hard line on sloppy lending already shows signs of softening."
Xiaomi IPO escalates China’s battle of the bourses,Netflix’s advantage is Facebook’s weakness. Subscriptions give the video-streaming service an edge – and an incentive for boss Reed Hastings to keep customers’ data close by. Cash burn is always a risk but for now Netflix is handily outperforming its FAANG associate.
The Exchange: Italy's almost premier,"Shareholders have a new problem with U.S. bank stocks - but at least now it's a luxury one. Bank of America on Monday revealed that it earned $6.9 billion in the first quarter of the year. That beat estimates, and like rival JPMorgan it was the best showing from the core business in years. Yet big banks’ shares have flatlined of late. That’s because they already reflect improved margins."
Viewsroom: AT&T win is unlikely to muzzle watchdogs,"Russia is limbering up to use its banks as a lifebelt – again. Finance minister Anton Siluanov said on April 11 that domestic lender Promsvyazbank could lend emergency funds to United Company Rusal, whose shares have been smashed by U.S. sanctions announced on April 6. If Rusal heralds the start of a wider assault, Moscow can deploy some familiar airbags."
ECB staggered retreat from QE makes sense,"Singapore is tapping the brakes on Southeast Asia's ride-hailing mega-merger. Antitrust regulators won’t halt U.S. giant Uber's deal with $6 billion local rival Grab, but have limited data-sharing and driver exclusivity contracts, at least while they review. That's a sign of potholes ahead."
Russia's Rosneft says U.S. statements on its Venezuela operations groundless,"U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz has come under Florida state bar scrutiny for a Twitter message that critics said was meant to intimidate President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, the night before his public testimony on Capitol Hill."
New York attorney general is investigating Trump projects: NY Times,"Announcing a chief executive’s departure late on a Saturday night is never the sign of a well-functioning board. When that CEO has been in charge for 32 years, as Martin Sorrell was at WPP, shareholders have extra reason to worry. The silver lining is that Chairman Roberto Quarta has options to kick-start a turnaround."
Democrats pick Milwaukee for 2020 presidential convention,"Every Thanksgiving, we descendants of William Bradford – the Mayflower voyager who became governor of the Plymouth Colony and broke bread with the locals during that first hard year on American soil – recall the story of how he and his fellow pilgrims fled their native land so they could freely practice their religious beliefs. Never in my half-century at the turkey table has the discussion acknowledged the possibility that Bradford and his cohorts were really "
Fox M&A battle could favour Sky investors,"A new casino game can be tricky to master. Stanley Ho, who at 96 is stepping down as chairman of SJM Holdings, enjoyed a decades-long head start in Macau, now by far the world’s biggest gaming hub. But SJM quickly lost ground to Wynn Macau, Galaxy Entertainment and others."
FIFA’s $25 bln backers could end up on losing team,"Instagram could do worse than unfriend Facebook. The photo-sharing site may be worth more than 80 times what the social network founded by Mark Zuckerberg paid six years ago. Now, though, the data leaks engulfing its corporate parent risk becoming a liability. Separating Instagram off – even if Facebook were to remain its biggest shareholder – might be a wise pre-emptive move."
China starts trading debt for growth,"IAG has picked a good time to chase Norwegian’s jet stream. The owner of British Airways may bid for budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle. The target’s plan to disrupt transatlantic travel is taking off, but its finances are stretched, and rival bidders could struggle to get off the ground."
"Holding: As AT&T case ends, trustbuster woes begin","Apollo’s Greyhound bet looks past UK politics. Transatlantic bus and rail company FirstGroup has rejected an approach from the U.S. buyout giant. The offer is bold given the backlash against Britain’s private rail operators. But the company’s American operations, which include the iconic long-distance buses, may hide some value."
Plumber ruling leaves blockage in UK gig economy ,Toys R Us has some growing up to do in Asia. The bankrupt U.S. toy seller has drawn bids of over $1 billion for its Asian unit. The business’s next owner will need to grapple with everything from digital strategy to a shrinking number of kids in Japan.
New ZTE regime could climb out of big hole,"Until fairly recently, a king could not be corrupt. Monarchs just did what they did, as the biblical prophet Samuel explained. “He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants,"" he told the ancient Israelites. ""He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants."""
"AT&T gets law right this time, but could regret it","European antitrust investigators may have found a rare example of a cartel that helps consumers. Groups including Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox were raided on Tuesday in a probe into the distribution of media rights for sports broadcasting. If collusion held down inflated rights prices, the main beneficiaries from its end would be already-loaded teams and athletes."
Tesla job cull is more signal than maneuver,"China's latest financial opening promises go in one direction. Central bank governor Yi Gang on Wednesday pledged to lower ownership barriers for foreign financiers by the end of the year, and added that a stock trading link with London could open in the same timeframe. Meanwhile China’s securities regulator quadrupled the daily stock trading quota with Hong Kong, clearing the way for foreign funds to buy more mainland equities. In keeping with long-standing C"

Trump and Kim’s TV diplomacy lacks definition,"HSBC is catering to China's soft power push, creating a job title sure to charm Beijing: Head of Belt and Road Initiative. The Asia-focused lender has staffed the role with senior banker Mukhtar Hussain, currently chief of HSBC Malaysia. Putting a heavy hitter in charge of coordinating efforts to tap the $1 trillion overseas infrastructure programme makes sense; rivals have employees playing similar roles without so exalted a title. Don't be surprised to see o"
U.S. transport chief: 'tight time frame' for $1 trillion infrastructure boost,U.S. lawmakers are zeroing in on the correct Facebook target. Whether they pull the trigger is another matter.
Trump budget proposes steep subsidy cuts to farmers as they grapple with crisis,A volley of words threatens a trade war between PRC leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump. Developing China has much at risk in fighting with the world’s largest economy. But American businesses are vulnerable too. Plus: Meituan goes all-in with local services.
"Trump 2020 budget slashes foreign aid, hikes defense spending: official","Donald Trump’s trade war risks a German carmaker backfire. BMW and Daimler sell a surprising number of American-made vehicles in China. Were the U.S. president’s tariff-war rhetoric to become reality, carmakers could shrink U.S. production. If he wants to keep jobs rather than lose them, he should seize a new olive branch from Beijing."
Only a bold call dials up $75 bln Xiaomi valuation,"Bayer and Monsanto’s two-year regulatory saga is almost over. The drug and crop-science groups struck a deal with antitrust regulators at the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the Wall Street Journal, clearing one of the final hurdles for a deal that values Monsanto’s equity at almost $60 billion. However, its iffy financial logic means Bayer shareholders can hold off the champagne."
Trump-Kim parley has a downside for Xi,China’s president Xi Jinping is throwing the trade ball back into Donald Trump’s court. Xi pledged yet more market opening on Tuesday. He rehashed plenty of old promises but dangled a few substantive ones on autos and other areas – and suggested they could happen quickly. The still-vague opening offer is unlikely to appease U.S. hardliners – or even moderates in the U.S. business community. But they do create space for President Donald Trump to justify continu
China’s $50 bln bid for market calm might backfire,"Washington lawmakers are fond of grandstanding, especially when they get the chance to grill a hapless executive. When U.S. congressional members interview Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday and Wednesday, the temptation will be to score points by focusing on his all-too-apparent flaws. If they’re smart, though, they’ll focus on a bigger issue: whether Facebook is too complex to manage, whoever runs it."
Exclusive: “Quitaly clause” marks new risk level,"President Emmanuel Macron has a lot to lose if French voters turn against his railway reform plans. So may the Europe Union. Any backlash against the overhaul of the Gallic train system could fuel resentment against the EU, whose rules are forcing the pace of change."
BT dividend cut would give next CEO room to invest,"China has a plan to lure back Big Tech.

Ant's $14 bln haul epitomises private excess,"Deutsche Bank has a new chief executive, but he faces the same strategic void.

UK’s Brexit backstop only a partial step forward,"Spare a thought for investors in EN+. The Russian power and aluminium group only listed on the London market five months ago, only for its depositary receipts to fall below the $14 debut price. Following Friday’s news that the energy group was being added to the U.S. sanctions list, its shares dropped another 20 percent."
Daily Mail editor picks shrewd time to move on,"These days, the innovation known as blockchain is almost always mentioned in association with two things.

Breakingviews has obtained a copy of the imaginary pitch headhunters have sent to prospective candidates."
Trump budget seeks 5 percent cut in non-defense spending: OMB,"HNA Group is restructuring in a rather roundabout way. The Chinese conglomerate already has offloaded stakes in two Hilton Worldwide spinoffs for a combined $2.4 billion, as part of a streamlining programme that includes publicly floating businesses and shedding real estate. Now it has put its 26 percent holding in the U.S. hotelier itself, worth roughly $6.4 billion, on the block, too."
"Exclusive: In budget, Trump to ask Congress for $8.6 billion for border wall","The music-streaming service enjoyed a mostly smooth stock-market debut despite largely bypassing investment banks. Ultimately, though, business success, not IPO hype, is what counts. Plus: Regulators and automakers are sparking up an altogether too cozy relationship."
Trump adviser: some time may pass before a third North Korea summit,"The fact that South Dakota’s official visitor website is available in Chinese speaks volumes about the links between the United States and the People’s Republic. Levies on Chinese TVs and microscopes, and U.S. soybeans and ginseng, threaten direct economic damage to both economies. But a reduction in the number of Chinese visitors to the United States, which has already begun, could hit a nerve that trade tariffs don’t reach."
The Exchange: A Down Under take on Trump,"Mark Zuckerberg could learn from Jamie Dimon. In the decade since the financial crisis, JPMorgan’s boss has regularly confronted issues and explained the firm’s strategy. Social networks, like banks, rely on confidence to survive and thrive. With Facebook facing a crisis of its own, its founder would do well to recognize that."
Expanded Heathrow’s value to rest of UK is hazy,"BlackRock may have found a disarmingly simple solution to its gun dilemma. The fund manager led by Larry Fink will offer an arsenal of new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms. Coupled with a plan to engage public gunmakers and sellers directly, it moves Fink closer to fulfilling a promise that BlackRock’s business benefit society alongside the bottom line."
Hadas: Financial freedom is not what Italy needs,There is no such thing as too much information for some central bank watchers. They will be cheered by the idea that the Bank of England’s rate-setters may be debating the merits of greater openness. But more information does not always translate into more insight.
Telco rules expose EU’s fake digital single market,"About a century ago, the evils of monopoly inspired an eponymous board game. Is it now time for a new variation? Monopsony, a term coined in the 1930s, refers to markets where a single buyer is dominant. The Monopsony game would hinge on all-powerful employers determining how much they will pay their workers."

Apple’s value can chug well past $1 trillion,"Sinclair Broadcast Group has taken upon itself the noble ambition of teaching Americans about democracy. Through an editorial edict, the company mandated anchors at its 193 local TV stations to tell viewers that sharing biased and false news has become commonplace and that some members of the media use their own platforms to push their personal bias. ""This is extremely dangerous to our democracy,"" its presenters bleated in unison."
RBS stake sale makes the best of a bad job,"SoftBank’s silly Swiss Re bet may be getting smaller. The Japanese tech and telecom group is unlikely to buy more than a 10 percent stake, the Swiss reinsurer announced on Wednesday. That’s substantially less than previously suggested. Given the dubious benefits of any tie-up, though, it’s still a questionable use of SoftBank’s cash."
Aussie cartel case bodes ill for equity bankers,"Elliott Management is targeting the right pressure points at Hyundai.

The $1 billion-plus investment by Hong Kong-based affiliate Elliott Advisors seems focused on the most sensitive aspects of Hyundai’s overhaul."
Starbucks boss seeks smoother second shot at exit,"Spotify won a stonking $29 billion valuation in its early moments as a public company. The music-streaming service’s non-traditional float saved on investment-banking fees, gave insiders a potential way out, and also notched up a far higher valuation – at least to begin with – than the prices at which its stock had traded while privately held. Was it a real victory, either for the company or for its unusual method? Ask this time next year."
Italy’s politics is new obstacle to UniCredit deal,Sky investors on Tuesday received a mini Easter egg. Walt Disney is ready to buy the pay-TV group’s news channel to smooth the regulatory process for merger partner Twenty-First Century Fox. This signal of Disney’s commitment to owning the UK broadcaster boosts the odds of a bidding war with rival Comcast.
"Senator McSally, an Air Force veteran, says she was raped by a superior officer","Harbour Energy clearly has a bold view on liquefied natural gas.

"U.S. Air Force Secretary Wilson to resign, leaving new vacancy",Spotify's direct listing piles risks upon risks. The music-streaming service’s market debut was unusual already – but it comes as specific fears over Facebook and Amazon are spilling over into wider tech valuations.
U.S. judge gives Trump ex-aide Manafort leniency: under four years in prison,"The social network founded by Mark Zuckerberg is reeling from a data harvest on some 50 million users. It will take time for the $440 billion firm to feel the impact but people are starting to slowly unplug. Plus, the world’s largest consumer-drone maker may go public."
1MDB scandal could yet bring some critical closure,Barclays boss Jes Staley has been made an offer he couldn’t refuse. The lender unexpectedly agreed on Thursday to pay the United States $2 billion to settle allegations that it mis-sold mortgage securities more than a decade ago rather than going to court. That still leaves Staley with some other big problems on his plate.
The Exchange: Anatomy of a Theranos takedown,"Facebook's social contract is coming unstuck. Its users provide massive amounts of data, which the company uses to sell advertising. In return, it provides a free service. The same is true of search engine Google. But while more data makes Google's service better and more accurate, it has tended to make Facebook less entertaining. With questions about how Facebook data was used in political campaigns, that could make users more wary of the trade-off."

Toshiba has reasons to cling to its cash pile,"North Korean despot Kim Jong Un is suddenly playing nice. Having thawed relations with Seoul during the winter Olympics, this week he kowtowed to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Hadas: Market complacency curses debtor countries,"Chinese banks look healthy enough to handle more debt medicine. Stable real estate and solid corporate profits helped boost big lenders’ earnings and margins in 2017, while manic asset growth slowed and risk buffers thickened. That clears space for newly empowered regulators to force more defaults, and address flaws in China’s debt-for-equity swap programme."
China script flipped at hedge fund idea-fest,"It's hard to take pity on Remington, the firm that manufactured the assault-style rifle used to murder 20 first-graders and six of their teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. But the gunmaker's bankruptcy is undeniably pitiful. Having massacred some $700 million of creditors' wealth, Remington finds itself with a group of reluctant lenders and accidental shareholders who just want out in a hurry."
U.S. judge dismisses Stormy Daniels' hush-money agreement case vs Trump,"Mukesh Ambani is playing a new tune. India's richest man, through his flagship conglomerate Reliance Industries, is merging two music-streaming services into one worth $1 billion. Reliance is following a well-trodden path of telecom operators dabbling in music, movies and other entertainment to attract subscribers. As his oil-to-retail giant starts to throw off cash, the tycoon could take his content ambitions to another level."
Democrats probe whether White House interfered in AT&T Time Warner merger,"Uber is revving up for an initial public offering by exiting another cut-throat market. On Monday, the U.S. ride-hailing giant said it would hand its Southeast Asian arm to Grab, a $6 billion local rival, and take 27.5 percent of the enlarged group.

She explains what can be done to mitigate the problem – and how doing too little costs businesses billions and can sink economic growth.
Volcker tweak reveals Powell Fed’s cautious streak,A political group backing President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election bid will run national television ads this week seeking to bolster support in Congress for his efforts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as lawmakers try to block him.
Sorrell’s new shell tests value of old contacts,Dropbox's initial public offering stores good news for upcoming tech floats. The online-storage firm’s shares rocketed about 50 percent in its first hours as a public company. The rousing welcome for a $12 billion tech firm aimed at consumers is heartening for Spotify. And it could accelerate IPO plans for firms like Airbnb and Lyft.
Cox: Peter Thiel’s next target should be Infowars,World markets are taking another step to embrace China. Bloomberg will add the country’s government and policy-bank bonds to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. That should attract foreign investors and encourage more liberalization. It’s also a useful reminder that flows of money far outweigh those of goods and services.
Alibaba's delivery route missing a few turns,"When news of AT&T’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner broke in October 2016, the U.S. Senate rushed to call a hearing. The bosses of both companies would testify. But lawmakers invited not Time Warner, but Time Warner Cable, a company spun off from Time Warner in 2009. Faux pas!"
Numbers add up to Germany retaining World Cup,"Some economics students want to change the profession. They deserve to succeed, but the rebels lack one really important element: compelling alternatives."
China’s flabby stock market set for a workout,"Facebook’s crisis could turn digital advertising’s duopoly into a triopoly. Marketers spooked by a data-handling scandal are threatening to pull money from the social network, which together with Google parent Alphabet sucked up 84 percent of online commercial budgets outside China last year, according to consultancy GroupM. Amazon could benefit."
Political crisis exposes Italy’s euro fault line,"Steve Wynn has left the building even if his name is still on it. In just two months since the 76-year-old casino mogul denied sexual-misconduct allegations, he has stepped down from leadership roles at Wynn Resorts and now is selling his entire stake in the eponymous $18 billion U.S. company. Meanwhile, new boss Matt Maddox is making the best of the bad hand dealt to him."
China would be wise to limit cornerstone investors,"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has been dealt some tough cards during his tenure. But right now, his hand could hardly be stronger. The economic and political stars are aligning in such a way that he will be able to raise interest rates in a couple of months’ time without giving critics much scope to complain."
"Holding: $1,745-an-hour lawyers due for disruption","Developers of self-driving cars have a legal lesson to learn from the pharmaceuticals industry. Autonomous vehicles should make road deaths like the one this week involving an Uber prototype a rarity. Paradoxically, as drugmakers found with vaccines, remaining mishaps may increase legal costs and drive companies out of the market. The pharma industry, though, found a solution."
OPEC supply easing is more reset than U-turn,"Inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approached $500 billion last year, according to ETF.com. Even with February's market ructions, another $64 billion arrived in just the first two months of the year. The rapid growth of these index-linked financial products is “worse than Marxism”. So argued the analysts at Bernstein back in the summer of 2016. Bernstein claimed that investors who adopt passive strategies are free-riders who abrogate their responsibility t"
"U.S. officials track migrant caravan activists, journalists: NBC","Yi Gang has experience working in America. Once considered a liability, that background now may be one of his greatest assets.

"Texan Ralph Hall, oldest person to serve in U.S. House, dies","A North Carolina judge on Friday ruled that two amendments, one requiring identification to vote and another capping the state income tax, were unconstitutional because racial gerrymandering meant that the state's legislature was ""illegally constituted."""
Senator Blumenthal seeks criminal investigation of shoddy military housing,"When Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Liu He, visited Washington in early March, he made a reasonable request. Told that U.S. President Donald Trump was uninterested in resuming the duo’s “strategic and economic dialogue”, Liu asked for updated and specific demands."
U.S.-China spat poses serious hazard for WTO,Mark Zuckerberg’s slow defense reveals real weakness. The Facebook founder finally explained how users’ information was harvested - four days after the incident was revealed by press reports. But his promise to tighten controls rings hollow. The trouble is the social network is built on data. Truly securing it may blow up its business.
How Comcast can boost its chances of snaring Fox,"U.S. rate hikes risk causing a global fallout. Gulf states, Hong Kong and others that peg their currency to the dollar worry that that following the Federal Reserve’s tightening might endanger growth. But with five more hikes expected by the end of 2019, not doing so risks the ire of financial markets."
Viewsroom: America sees red on China trade deal,"China’s goal is to be “a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence”. Those are the words of Xi Jinping, who has just won approval to extend his term as president indefinitely. Xi wants the People’s Republic to supplant the United States as the world’s leading nation."
Italy premier’s to-do list would tax a veteran,"In Goethe’s Faust, the protagonist makes a deal with the devil’s envoy by exchanging his soul for the fulfilment of earthly goals. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, faced with decidedly unholy lowball returns on tangible equity, face a similar dilemma as they struggle to meet their cost of capital. Germany’s two biggest banks by assets should swallow their pride and hook up.  "
U.S. threatens autos with scorched-earth gambit,"Australian billionaire James Packer has resigned from the board of his casino group once again, this time for health reasons. He leaves the $7 billion Crown Resorts still recovering from a Chinese crackdown that left staff in prison and prompted a costly retreat. The path forward is clearer without him."
StanChart dream reveals Barclays’ limited options,"Six years ago, when Facebook was going public, investors bent over backwards to grant Mark Zuckerberg near-totalitarian power over the social network he founded in his Harvard dorm room by letting him hold special super-voting stock. The reasoning was that the young chairman and chief executive needed ""runway"" to build Facebook, without the pesky distractions most public companies face from unwashed shareholder hordes."
Santos gambles on crude with $11 bln bid rebuff,"Where should multinational tech companies pay income tax? Changing international rules devised a century ago will be difficult, but Europe is right that asset-light, data-hungry businesses like Google and Facebook  merit fresh thinking."
Rollback of Dodd-Frank won’t roll back time,"Six years ago, when Facebook was going public, investors bent over backwards to grant Mark Zuckerberg near-totalitarian power over the social network he founded in his Harvard dorm room by letting him hold special super-voting stock. The reasoning was that the young chairman and chief executive needed ""runway"" to build Facebook, without the pesky distractions most public companies face from unwashed shareholder hordes."
Italy’s next economy minister is the one to watch,"China's regulatory mega-merger cries out for some significant synergies. A newly simplified organizational chart combines banking and insurance regulation while eliminating and consolidating the work of other ministries. It should reduce fees, red tape and corruption. The benefits will be limited, though, if headcounts aren't slashed, too. The country's 7 million bureaucrats have grown too fond of mindless crackdowns."
Ant Financial quacks like a bank,"The Manhattan district attorney is pursuing criminal charges against Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, whether or not Trump pardons him for his federal convictions, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday."
"At State of the Union, women in white stand up (or sit down) to Trump",Mark Zuckerberg has handed users one more reason to quit Facebook. Newspaper reports that a UK political consultancy used millions of user profiles creates fresh risks at the social network he founded. People are already spending less time on Facebook. The danger is that members may unfriend it altogether.
Who is Martha McSally? Former fighter pilot in Senate reveals her rape,"The latest Brexit deal buys little more than time. The agreement unveiled on Monday effectively keeps Britain in the European Union until the end of 2020, giving companies longer to prepare for departure. But key disputes about the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU are unresolved, and the risk of a chaotic exit remains."
Ex-Trump attorney Cohen hands over new documents to Congress,"For a business built on growing friendships, Facebook is making an astonishing number of enemies. Revelations by two newspapers that some 50 million of its user profiles were inappropriately harvested add to a growing list of outcries over the social network's practices. It has come to the point where founder Mark Zuckerberg will have to prove somehow he is not in way over his head."
French telco M&A requires more than regulatory nod,"Investors in crypto-currencies may be in for a surprise. To hear the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators tell it, many initial coin offerings – or ICOs – of digital tokens like bitcoin are actually securities, and subject to rigorous rules. That’s far from clear, though, judging from a handful of cases making their way through the courts. A ruling against the government could add to the confusion."
Sony loudly demonstrates love of content with EMI,China’s President Xi Jinping can now stay in power for life. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein seems ready to retire after 12 years at the top. Yet five years may be the ideal length of service. Breakingviews columnists discuss the limitations to limitless rule.
Hadas: Vatican asks the right financial questions,"Li Ka-shing's retirement is the end of a long era. The Hong Kong magnate built a property-to-telecoms empire. At 89, Li said on Friday he would step down in May. The move comes as the financial hub faces economic and political uncertainty, while protectionism globally is on the rise. That is a tough new reality for his eldest son and successor."
Breakdown: EU gains new powers for Big Tech fight,Spinning off supermarkets is a good start for Wesfarmers. The A$50 billion Australian conglomerate plans to list Coles separately. Pushing out the slow-growth company should make the rest more appealing to investors. A broader carve-up also would make sense.
Review: Silicon Valley gets a reality transfusion,"Amazon and Aramco would seem to have little in common apart from their shared first letter. The Saudi giant sucks oil from Arabian sands and sells it to energy-thirsty nations, sending the proceeds back to its controlling monarchy. Amazon sells stuff online, ships it to customers rapidly and reinvests the profits to destroy the economics of every industry it enters."
The Exchange: The failure and future of globalism,"Private equity may prove its long-term bona fides in Asia. After years of wrestling with protective family founders and entrenched corporate attitudes, new research suggests the buyout model is paying off."
UK’s costly royal wedding is worth every penny,"President Donald Trump is moving from the A-list to the CNBC-list with his new pick for top economic adviser. Larry Kudlow is a seasoned media communicator, and a mostly conventional supply-sider and free trader. But guiding policy for the world’s largest economy requires more than pontificating on television. It's another sign of this White House's increasingly shallow talent pool."
Citi’s Hong Kong slap has lesson for new IPO boom,"U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, supports the federal government issuing reparations to black Americans who were economically affected by slavery, she said on Thursday."
Closing tech’s gender gap will take decades,"Theresa May is pushing back against Russia. The UK prime minister on Wednesday announced that Britain would expel 23 Russian diplomats in response to what she said was their state’s involvement in a March 4 nerve-agent attack in Salisbury, England. That won’t change much, but May has other powers that could make more of a difference."
China's airlines are set for a long-haul price war,"Stephen Schwarzman has schooled China Investment Corp on the art of the deal. China’s sovereign wealth fund has offloaded its stake in Blackstone, according to documents the $42 billion private equity firm filed with U.S. regulators on March 1. It bagged a so-so return over the decade or so of its investment, while the partnership helped the buyout behemoth open some lucrative doors in the world’s second-largest economy."
Trump rose on Forbes richest list as other billionaires slipped,"Apple is acquiring the goodwill of flag-waving magazine publishers for less than pocket change. The $925 billion iPhone maker is buying Texture, a digital subscription service for titles like Rolling Stone. The pixelated newsstand was intended as an antidote to Apple’s onerous terms. With the print industry suffering, though, buying it makes the tech giant look like a white knight."
"Democrats' Twitter war: Should U.S. borrow a lot, or a whole lot?","No wonder Rex Tillerson was willing to diverge from his boss on Monday and call out Russia directly for the alleged poisoning of a former double agent living in Britain. The U.S. secretary of state already knew President Donald Trump might sack him, according to press reports. The former chief executive of Exxon Mobil may not have been in Trump’s inner circle. But his exit on Tuesday shrinks the already shallow White House talent pool – and America’s welcome ma"
"White House pressures automakers on fuel rules, blocking California: sources","On his landmark album Exodus, Bob Marley crooned about the importance of keeping the faith. British Chancellor Philip Hammond’s plea for mutual recognition with the European Union is similarly designed to forestall a crisis of confidence among London-based investment banks. Large-scale job flight can be avoided – provided UK regulators stick to EU rules."
Ocado investment case requires heavy guesswork,"The death of Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm at the hand of Donald Trump leaves a worrying fog for others to navigate. The U.S. president blocked the Singapore-based chipmaker's $117 billion hostile offer on Monday evening, citing national-security concerns. But torpedoing a deal before it's even agreed, and for vague reasons, adds to fears of protectionism."
Viewsroom: 1MDB rears head in Malaysian election,"The latest carve-up of Germany’s energy sector makes more sense than previous reshuffles. RWE is dividing up its ailing Innogy unit in a deal with rival E.ON. The former will focus on generating power, while the latter will specialise in distributing it. A knotty asset swap complicates the financial picture but the strategic thinking is hard to fault."
Italian radical agenda is a recipe for chaos,"Old IPOs are bringing new problems for UBS. Hong Kong’s securities regulator intends to suspend the Swiss bank from sponsoring local market debuts for 18 months. Fees for such advisory work may be marginal, but preserving the wealth management brand with Asian entrepreneurs will be a challenge."
Morgan Stanley has paid off smartly for MUFG,"China’s economy has long defied the doom-mongers. In place of their ominous critique, a more constructive view of economic management in the People’s Republic has surfaced. Beijing, we are told, has found the right balance between state and market forces, and is best positioned to exploit exciting new technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence. Politically fractured and economically sclerotic western nations can only look on in envy."
Get ready to gamble – on U.S. sports betting,"China is rolling out the welcome mat for technology companies - and Taiwan. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics assembler and key Apple supplier, is set to list a $50 billion-plus subsidiary in Shanghai.

Vodafone CEO leaves hard work to his successor,"Imposing levies on steel and aluminum has lost the president his economic adviser, ex-Goldman No. 2 Gary Cohn. That has shocked investors out of complacency. Also: Italy’s elections leave fringe parties in charge. And big deals may be back on the agenda for the mining industry."
Breakingviews- Tangled loyalties complicate China Tower IPO,"Imposing levies on steel and aluminum has lost the president his economic adviser, ex-Goldman No. 2 Gary Cohn. That has shocked investors out of complacency. Also: Italy’s elections leave fringe parties in charge. And big deals may be back on the agenda for the mining industry."
Italy’s radical government will be an EU headache,"American metal tariffs’ status as the most worrying element of the Trump administration’s trade policy may soon face competition. The president’s steel and aluminum levies, announced on Thursday, helped persuade Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser, to resign this week. A probe into Chinese intellectual property policy could prove more devastating, though."
India Insight: Narendra Modi has lost the boardroom,"Britain and Saudi Arabia are having a trade love-in. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received the red carpet treatment in London this week, meeting both Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth. While warm words have been backed up by a pledge for 65 billion pounds of new trade and investment, the two are starting from a low base."
New York regulator subpoenas insurance broker over Trump Organization dealings,"Abertis’ bidders may have a way to avoid becoming M&A roadkill. Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS are mulling a breakup of the Spanish group, newspapers Expansion and El Confidencial reported on March 8 – instead of each bidding against the other. It would nix the idea of a pan-European global leader. But it would be politically easier, and remove the very real risk of overpaying."
Trump to nominate federal prosecutor Jessie Liu for No. 3 Justice Department post,"Women are creeping into Asia’s boardrooms. Although one fifth of firms in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index still have all-male boards, new appointments of women directors are rising. The next task, in the city and elsewhere in the region, is to ensure women are present in sufficient numbers for companies to reap the full rewards of diversity. "
Conservatives target Ocasio-Cortez's 'Green New Deal' in New York billboards,"U.S. President Donald Trump is on the brink of triggering a transatlantic trade war with his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. That’s bad enough for the global economy. But by invoking a little-used national security loophole to justify his belligerence, he may be opening an even bigger can of worms."
The Exchange: Indonesia’s startup boom,The idea behind “Doughnut Economics” is a good one. But it will have to become much better if it is to do more than pander to a limited group’s ideological sweet-tooth.
Review: Get used to your bullsh*t job,"China's bank regulator is easing buffers required for problem loans, according to media reports. This is another incremental move to offset a crackdown on shadow banking. More cash for lending will boost bank profits, especially at smaller institutions – or make it easier to bring off-balance-sheet assets back aboard. Even so, Beijing is relaxing too quickly about bad debt."
Zoopla lures new twist on classic UK property punt,Gary Cohn’s exit turns White House chaos into the markets’ problem. The ex-Goldman Sachs banker stood as a buffer against anti-trade voices in President Donald Trump’s administration – and is now leaving just as Trump ramps up protectionist talk. Markets have been phlegmatic about disorder in Washington. That can no longer be taken for granted.
Malaysia can push for a healthy China rebalance,"President Donald Trump plans to nominate Jeffrey Rosen as the next deputy U.S. attorney general, the White House said on Tuesday night, the latest shuffle in the Justice Department at a time when it faces close scrutiny over its Russia investigation."
Viewsroom: What’s eating at Elon Musk?,"Policy tensions are curbing spirits that should be soaring in the U.S. energy sector. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will break bread with U.S. shale producers at an industry confab in Houston, Texas, this week, a sign of American wildcatters’ influence on the global market. But infrastructure bottlenecks and President Donald Trump’s new tariffs threaten to prevent drillers from taking full advantage of their clout."
Mark Carney may flummox markets again,A landmark national election leaves Italy with only radical options. An anti-establishment surge has crushed the chances of another moderate government taking charge of the euro zone’s third-largest economy. The maverick 5-Star Movement or the hard-right League are best placed to lead a new coalition.
Turkish politics will subvert currency defence,"Washington has waded into Broadcom's effort to buy rival chipmaker Qualcomm for $117 billion. America’s foreign-investment watchdog has told Qualcomm to delay by 30 days its annual shareholder meeting, previously set for Tuesday. The agenda includes director elections that could give board control to nominees of Singapore-based Broadcom. It’s a surprising twist in an already tangled situation. But it may remove a big unknown from the equation."
Markets want soothing after Malaysia poll upset,"MILAN - Protest is the big winner of Italy’s election. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is on track to win almost a third of the vote in a landmark poll that delivered a hung parliament. Support for the anti-immigration League also surged to record levels. If the two radical forces team up, they may have the seats to govern the euro zone’s third-largest economy. But whatever coalition emerges, it’s clear that investors and pollsters have once again underestimated voters’ unhappiness."
Hadas: Technology is still working pretty well,Delegates at the opening of China's annual political conferences on Monday were invited to apply their well-worn rubber stamps to a retread of 2017's economic plan. Chief economic planner Liu He promised this year’s World Economic Forum that his country would surprise foreigners with the aggressiveness of its reforms. Not so far.
Europe has uphill fight to keep Iran trade flowing,"The world's largest fund manager has put those who make or sell America’s preferred weapon of mass murder in its crosshairs. On Friday BlackRock, which oversees more than $6 trillion, outlined steps to ensure the three publicly traded arms manufacturers in which it owns stock make ""a positive contribution to society."" It won't solve America's gun-violence epidemic, but by engaging with gunmakers and distributors rather than divesting, BlackRock provides a bluep"
"House Democrats target Trump-Putin talks, obstruction","Richard Koo’s latest book is less ambitious than he originally planned. The chief economist of the Nomura Research Institute explains that this was supposed to be a joint project with his brother, “a well-known dermatologist”, who had “some fascinating insights” on “the evolution of religion and morality”. That collaboration was precluded by John Koo’s obligation to speak about new psoriasis drugs. However, “The Other Half of Macroeconomics and the Fate of Global"
Ivanka Trump could be on next target list from House Democrats: panel chairman,"Zhou Hongyi may have pulled off one of history’s great trades. The Chinese executive led a $9.3 billion management buyout of New York-listed antivirus company Qihoo 360 in 2016. Now its successor, 360 Security Technology, is trading in Shanghai at a $56 billion market capitalisation. That value difference far outstrips what most hedge funds or commodity traders achieve in years of arbitraging price anomalies."

Indian hospital penta-scrum poses board quandary,"A $1.8 bln scam at Punjab National Bank comes just months after the government injected $32 bln to bail out 20-odd state-run financial institutions. The scandal may increase calls for them to be privatized. Elsewhere: Will Sky be the limit for Comcast, Disney or Fox?"
U.S. fires trio of bullets at own foot over Iran,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, returning to the bench for the first time since undergoing lung cancer surgery in December, jumped right into the fray on Tuesday, posing the first question in oral arguments as is her custom."

Cheques for millennials stoke UK’s asset bubble,"LONDON - Martin Sorrell has raised the spectre of adland stagnation. The boss of advertising bellwether WPP, which lost 2.5 billion pounds of market value on Thursday morning, said 2018 revenue could be flat and reduced long-term earnings targets. Mad Men will have to get used to an increasingly frugal future."
The Exchange: The fate of Venezuela,"Beijing's grip is tightening. Authorities are now investigating the boss of fast-growing oil trader CEFC China Energy, the influential magazine Caixin reported on Thursday. This comes days after regulators took control of Anbang, a recklessly ambitious insurer. For foreign counterparties, it is ever harder to divine which private-sector leaders are vulnerable to, or shielded from, Beijing's wrath."
Takeda swallows big dose of risk to buy Shire,"Which gunmaker will be the first to stop manufacturing the preferred weapon of American mass murderers? With the decision by Dick's Sporting Goods to take assault weapons off its shelves, it's a matter of time before one of the big producers of consumer firearms gets out of tactical weapons and reverts to its self-defense and hunting roots. Aside from the message that would send to future customers, it would probably be good business."
Higher rates are likely to calm Hong Kong property,"Carolyn McCall’s first earnings as boss of ITV on Wednesday showed a familiar trend. The UK free-to-air broadcaster’s traditional business is shrinking, while its online audience is large but not very profitable. Filling that gap requires investment in advertising technology. A lower payout at least gives McCall some headroom."
Nestlé gets welcome jolt from Starbucks deal,"The big diggers have emerged from 2017 in rude health: BHP, Rio Tinto and Glencore's combined net debt is down to a third of where they ended 2013. The trio will soon need to do more than raise payouts to shareholders but tougher geology and high prices mean that, rather than deal-making, the next phase of growth may be unorthodox."
Chinese tech stars are MAXD out beyond FANG stocks,"Georgia just hoisted a massive red flag for Amazon. The $730-billion e-commerce behemoth is finalizing plans for a second headquarters. It had selected Atlanta among 20 North American locations drawn from hundreds of proposals. At stake are 50,000 jobs and $5 billion of investment. The Peach State's Republican legislators have now given founder Jeff Bezos the best reason yet to strike Atlanta off Amazon's shortlist."
Robo-Buffett no longer such a ridiculous notion,Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts just did the deal equivalent of a photobomb. But it’s Rupert Murdoch who may end up smiling.
Democrats may have votes to block Trump's border emergency in U.S. Senate,"Comcast boss Brian Roberts is driving a Sky-shaped wedge between Walt Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox. The U.S. cable group’s 22 billion pound ($31 billion) offer for the UK pay-TV group leaves Fox chair Rupert Murdoch with two unappealing options: enter a bidding war for Sky, or re-think his deal to sell Fox’s entertainment assets to Disney chief Bob Iger."
California: Pulling federal high-speed rail funds would be 'disastrous',"Alibaba’s food-delivery roadmap is starting to look a little less grubby. The Chinese e-commerce titan is working on a plan to buy the roughly three-quarters of Ele.me – which transports meals from restaurants to homes – that it doesn't already own. Doing such a deal simply to challenge Chinese tech outfit Meituan Dianping would be a costly endeavour, but if it can enhance Alibaba’s payments, grocery and parcel operations it makes more sense."
U.S. agency to cancel $929 million in California high-speed rail funds,"Activists in Washington, Chicago and dozens of other U.S. cities protested on Monday's Presidents Day holiday against President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency to secure funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall."

Doing such a deal simply to challenge Chinese tech outfit Meituan Dianping would be a costly endeavour, but if it can enhance Alibaba’s payments, grocery and parcel operations it makes more sense."
Review: Saving central bankers from the mob,"Billy Graham almost never spoke about economic or social controversies. The evangelist, who died last week at 99, preached the Christian faith and largely left good works to take care of themselves. Arguably, American society would have benefited from a more activist Graham."
Asia shoulders too much of HSBC's burden,"Jeremy Corbyn is playing hardball with a soft Brexit. The Labour Party leader says Britain should stay in a customs union when it leaves the European Union. Though his vision is fuzzy, it may appeal to voters and galvanise a parliamentary challenge to embattled Prime Minister Theresa May. UK political instability looks set to step up a gear."
Asia shoulders too much of HSBC's burden,"The failure of a Latvian bank poses an 8 billion euro question for the country’s financial system. That is the amount foreigners have deposited with lenders in the Baltic nation – equivalent to roughly 30 percent of GDP. ABLV, the third-largest bank, is to be wound up after U.S. regulators charged it with money laundering. The cost to local taxpayers will be limited. But it will be harder to contain the fallout for the overall banking system."
AIA sends mixed signals on growth,"A potential president for life in Beijing bodes ill for governance. China’s rubber-stamp legislature is set to scrap term limits for leaders, meaning President Xi Jinping could stay around well beyond 2023, when his second term finishes. For foreign executives and investors, this further consolidation of power makes government even less predictable and raises the risk of poor decisions taken in an information vacuum."
Viewsroom: M&A gets carried away,"Most big investment managers don’t publicly compare the acquisitive desires of a chief executive to the sex drive of a “ripening teenager.” Warren Buffett isn’t the typical big investment manager, which is why Berkshire Hathaway has beaten the market for 36 of the last 52 years. Buffett still serves up the ample returns and folksy advice his fans love. But if a generational shift is underway, he is on the wrong side of it."
UK tabloids’ dire top line strengthens M&A case,"The day before Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, he delivered a speech widely remembered for its closing passage, when the reverend said he was unafraid to die because he had ""been to the mountaintop."" Few seem to recall an earlier part of his oration where King exhorted African-Americans to use their purchasing power, and specifically boycott Coca-Cola, Wonder Bread and Sealtest milk."
Chinese handset-maker Xiaomi wins tech IPO bingo,The parable of the prodigal son tells the story of a young wastrel who squanders his inheritance only to beg forgiveness from a beneficent father. Royal Bank of Scotland is no stranger to contrite shareholder grovelling having delivered persistent losses since the financial crisis.  The state-controlled lender’s first net profit in a decade brings deliverance – in the form of dividend payments – tantalisingly near.
Tesla speeding toward capital raise crunch time,"The seizure of Anbang Insurance Group flips the script on Chinese takeovers. Authorities have commandeered the acquisitive insurer – a buyer of New York’s Waldorf Astoria and onetime suitor of $14 billion Starwood Hotels – and prosecuted its boss, Wu Xiaohui. It is the boldest step yet in Beijing’s battle against financial excess. The move also could be a worrying omen for others."
Sainsbury’s shows need for new antitrust approach,"What’s the value of celebrity? It’s not just a theoretical question. Reality-star-model-cosmetic-maker Kylie Jenner wiped more than $1.5 billion from Snap's wobbly market capitalization on Thursday after she questioned the usefulness of its main product, disappearing-message app Snapchat. Influential fans can attract users, and repel them if they publicly flee. Balance sheets don’t capture that kind of asset, but maybe they should."
"Centrist Democrats stray on votes, roiling House majority party","Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman who helped play a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has been released from federal prison after serving about 14 months for exchanging sexually explicit texts with a 15-year-old girl."
"Trump, on House probe, says, 'I cooperate all the time'",Broadcom has lowered its hostile bid for Qualcomm after its target upped its longstanding offer for NXP. That decreases the chance the two larger rivals can strike a deal – assuming regulators wouldn’t nuke it. Plus: Credit Suisse shines a rare light on Asian investment banking.
Foreign partners excluded for now from U.S. lawsuits against Cuban firms: official,"The U.S. Treasury’s view on what happens when big financial companies fail is about right. A long-awaited report recommends beefing up the bankruptcy code in case a large financial institution needs to be resolved, while keeping the door open to government intervention. It’s possible to quibble with the details, but the big-picture proposals strike a sensible balance."
Hadas: Shrinking to greatness is next CEO trick,Barclays is solving one of its four big problems. Chief Executive Jes Staley said on Thursday he plans to more than double 2018 dividends to 6.5 pence per share – about the level where he cut payouts in 2016. Great – except there are still three other headaches.
Chinese telco investors have rare reason to cheer,"Beware any chief executive without a Plan B. Westfield boss Peter Lowy is the latest to lack one, declaring on Thursday that despite a big drop in the value of a takeover bid from Unibail-Rodamco, there is no alternative to the sale he and his mall operator agreed in December, originally worth $25 billion including debt. The French buyer also says it has no intention of changing the deal terms. Investors could be forgiven for having other ideas."
Apple is bumping up against iPhone limits,"“What about that stock market?” Share prices are a bit like the weather, an easy topic for conversation. U.S. President Donald Trump is fairly typical in gloating when American stocks go up. However, some sensible people – economists and central bankers – also take share prices seriously, especially when they drop as far and fast as they did in the recent selloff. But really, what about that market? Is there any good reason to care?"
Cox: Gun taint prods a corporate restructuring,"António Horta-Osório wants the UK’s largest retail bank to be simple and safe. His new plan needs conduct charges, which grew by a fifth last year, to abate, and the economy to behave. Still, a plan to cut costs could help double earnings even if revenues stay flat."
Squeezed Facebook is set to squeeze others,"Santos could shift from prey to predator. Full-year results show the Australian gas producer is on the mend, with a narrowing net loss, less debt and more cash. That vindicates last year’s rejection of an opportunistic private equity-backed bid. The next challenge is shifting to growth - which could send the $9 billion group hunting for deals."
BP’s marathon repair job gets sprint finish,KFC’s penny-pinching ways have left it stuffed. The fried-chicken chain owned by Yum Brands had to close hundreds of its UK restaurants after running out of poultry. Its plan to cut costs by ditching its old food supplier for a cheaper one backfired. The cock-up shows that chasing higher margins is no sure way to feather your nest.
Apple may double capital returned to investors,"Stuart Gulliver claims to have left behind a “simpler, stronger” bank than the one he took charge of in January 2011. The departing HSBC chief executive is mostly right. He has shrunk the Asia-focused lender’s geographical footprint and boosted its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to a hefty 14.5 percent. Though return on equity fell short of Gulliver’s target last year, following winds should help his successor clear that hurdle."
Sainsbury’s tries to succeed where Walmart flopped,"Foxconn is aiming to manufacture something different in a new location. The Taiwanese assembler of Apple's iPhones plans to spin off a subsidiary in Shanghai. Fresh funds will help it push into new technologies. Given the nature of stock trading in China, it also could be retooling its valuation."
Sprint sale sharpens SoftBank's vision,"Self-described ""dirty trickster"" Roger Stone will still be able to speak about his upcoming criminal trial under a gag order issued on Friday, but the U.S. judge handling the case warned the former adviser to Donald Trump that he might want to choose his words carefully."
T-Mobile and Sprint pitch America First 5G deal,"Should Jeremy Corbyn win Britain’s next election, his Labour Party has said it will end private sector ownership of natural monopolies like water companies. The received wisdom is that returning utilities to the public sector will be exorbitantly expensive. But that depends how it’s done. "
Trump says big U.S. savings in curbing joint South Korea military drills,"Wall Street is turning the task of paying chief executives into something akin to snowboard cross. The Winter Olympics sport features half-a-dozen contestants hurling themselves down a narrow, twisting course with massive jumps, each trying to grab a few inches of advantage over the other while avoiding collisions. The pay race for six of America’s top bank bosses is becoming similarly bunched up."
U.S. agency probing two fatal Tesla crashes in Florida since last Sunday,It can be difficult to stay on when all your peers are retiring. That’s the case for Haruhiko Kuroda who will be reappointed Bank of Japan governor. The continuity at the helm of the Japanese central bank contrasts with a changing of the guard in the United States and Europe and reduces the chances of major monetary policy shifts in Tokyo. But Kuroda faces some tricky challenges.
"Ostrich jacket, fake rallies, therapy dogs and other odd scenes in Trump-Russia probe","When does taking a stand against social harm outweigh a financial objective? It’s a reasonable question for the likes of Lazard and BlackRock. The Wall Street investment bank advised AR-15 maker Remington on its restructuring days before Wednesday’s school shooting in Florida, perpetrated with a similar rifle – yet its asset managers talk about responsibility. So does Larry Fink, who runs BlackRock, the $6 trillion fund-management giant and top owner of firearm"
The Exchange: China’s one-man revolution,"Higher wages, inflation fears and the prospect of faster than expected rate hikes are posing challenges market players haven’t seen for years. Comcast may spike Walt Disney’s potion to acquire Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment assets. Plus, Singapore’s airshow has everyone buzzing."
Mark Carney can delay UK rate rise with impunity,"German politics has become Europe’s weak link. Though the country’s left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) last week clinched a coalition deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel, the party is now putting the agreement to grassroot members. Infighting means this is no longer a rubber stamp. A rejection would make it harder to push through reforms to the euro zone."
Baidu's revival adds speed to China's AI race,"Credit Suisse’s openness about Asia is yet to pay off. Since taking over in 2015, Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam has been keen to ensure the $47 billion group is seen as the “entrepreneurs’ bank” in a region where managing private fortunes goes hand in hand with cutting corporate deals. "
Microsoft is designated driver of the tech world,"The recent correction in global equity markets may turn out to be merely temporary indigestion involving algorithms. Nonetheless, it was the increase in the annual rate of U.S. wage growth to 2.9 percent in January that set the trading programmes in motion. The unexpected 0.5 percent monthly jump in American consumer prices adds to the excitement. This might be significant, if it indicates the arrival of an era when the economy once again follows some long-suspen"
"Amazon is getting bigger, but also heavier","Sky and BT are imposing unfamiliar austerity on British soccer. Three years after they agreed to pay 5.1 billion pounds for broadcast rights, the two companies bought the rights to air a similar number of games for 4.5 billion pounds. That suggests a self-destructive bidding war has ended, and will force the Premier League to look to new bidders and international rights to make up the difference. "
Diminished Deutsche Bank resembles cut-price BNP,"Baidu is following the right script with a video spinoff. On Tuesday, the $78 billion Chinese search engine operator confirmed it plans to list the Netflix-like iQiyi, which could be worth $8 billion or more. Outside investment will help as the unit burns cash on shows and battles rivals for viewers. Lessening the financial burden on Baidu also means more time to deliver on its bets in artificial intelligence."
U.S. squeeze could rally China tech behind Beijing,"U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Iran of Nazi-like anti-Semitism on Friday, maintaining his harsh rhetoric against Tehran just a day he attacked European powers for trying to undermine U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic."
Facebook’s future could look like Microsoft’s past,"South Africa wants to move forward, but Jacob Zuma is applying the brakes. That’s been the story ever since the scandal-hit president was elected in 2009. While Zuma is still clinging to power, the ruling African National Congress party’s decision on Tuesday to remove him marks a turning point."
Comcast is best leaving Fox to the Mouse,HNA Group could be preparing for a great escape. Selling half of a marquee Hong Kong project for $2 billion will raise useful cash amid a liquidity crisis. Plenty of other foreign property and shareholdings could be sold too without disrupting the Chinese outfit’s core businesses.
Sky upside depends on Disney-Fox irrationality,"President Donald Trump’s budget is mostly fan fiction for Republicans. The administration is calling for big cuts to non-military programs in its $4.4 trillion budget for 2019. Last week’s two-year spending deal effectively dooms the plan, though it may offer a blueprint for GOP budget hawks. Infrastructure, meanwhile, offers one hope of bipartisan dealmaking."
Manafort seeks sentence well below guidelines in Virginia case,"Heineken’s number two status comes with marginal costs as well as benefits. The Dutch group is one of the few global brewers still managing to boost beer volumes. However, acquisitions will weigh on its operating margins in 2018."
Warmbier parents blast 'evil' North Korea regime after Trump praises Kim,"An era of reckless lending is proving hard to shake off. On Friday, State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported an unexpected dip into the red. It’s a poor start to the tenure of new Chairman Rajnish Kumar, but at least he has a good idea of where the bank is headed."
Warmbier parents blast 'evil' North Korea regime after Trump praises Kim,"Uber Technologies is handing Waymo at least a partial victory in the driverless-car race. The ride-hailing service is paying Alphabet's self-driving unit $245 million in equity, ending a legal fight over trade secrets. More importantly than the money, though, the settlement recasts an existential question about Uber."
Hadas: Debt overload is an easy problem to solve,"Deciding whether to hold bonds or stocks these days is akin to choosing between the frying pan and the fire. Rising U.S. Treasury yields helped trigger an equity market decline that this week officially became a correction. Given that fiscal and monetary policies could hurt even the safest government debt, cash may become the most prized of all assets in the selloff."
Credit Suisse valuation gives no margin for error,"Organizing the Olympics is generally a losing economic proposition. In one financial competition, though, South Korea can aim for bronze."
Breakingviews- Viewsroom: America puts ZTE in the sin bin,"The infighting and reality-dodging that surrounds Britain’s exit from the European Union can seem like a grim comedy. However, it is no laughing matter that members of the government consider it their patriotic duty to criticise and ignore advice which doesn’t validate their view. Expert economists, however, have not stopped estimating just how bad it will be. And rather than exhibiting bias against Brexit, if anything they show too much optimism."
Hong Kong opens doors to far-from-super governance,"Pier Carlo Padoan, who has run Rome's Ministry of Economy and Finance for the past four years and under its last two prime ministers, says Italy must continue economic reforms no matter who wins elections in March. Padoan also predicts no ""Italian surprise"" at the polls."
Wells Fargo shareholders give CEO welcome respite,"U.S. President Donald Trump was poised on Friday to declare a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, a move that Democrats vowed to challenge as an unconstitutional attempt to fund his proposed border wall without approval from Congress."
U.S. sanctions rethink is only partly reassuring,"Chair Janet Yellen forbids the $2 trln lender from growing bigger - on her last day in the job, and 17 months after Wells’ fake-accounts scandal hit. Meanwhile, fellow financial watchdog CFPB seems to be giving hacked Equifax a free pass. Plus: how Nintendo made a comeback."
Hyundai agitator gets overly ambitious,"Investors who have earned big bucks by betting against VIX futures were hammered when volatility spiked on Monday. The global stock markets also dipped sharply. Conventional wisdom suggests it’s a good thing to take a little froth out of the market. Besides, the economy's fundamentals remain robust, adds U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. And it's true that investors quickly recovered their nerves in the following days. "
Breakingviews- Google’s owner starts to look like Alphabet soup,"For all its independence, the Bank of England is at the mercy of politicians. The central bank’s boss, Mark Carney, said on Thursday that UK interest rates may rise sooner and by a bit more than previously anticipated. But that assumes Britain’s exit from the European Union is smooth. If Prime Minister Theresa May fails to secure a transition deal in the next few months, the governor will have to backtrack."
U.S. bond yields may be throwing investors a curve,"Look past the iffy pizza and Yum China remains delicious. On Wednesday evening, the mainland operator of KFC reported its first full set of annual results since spinning off from parent Yum Brands in late 2016. The smaller Pizza Hut business is still a work in progress, but shows signs of improvement. Meanwhile, the $17 billion parent looks like a straightforward, fast-growing and fairly cheap bet on the rise of the Chinese consumer."
UBS strength helped by two temporary leg-ups,Elon Musk is fiddling while Tesla burns. The entrepreneur has recently pulled off successful PR stunts for his other firms. And he has just broadened the electric-car maker’s funding options. But Tesla looks set to incinerate truckloads of greenbacks this year.
Senators propose bill to let thousands of Venezuelans remain in U.S.,Marriages involve give and take. The one that German Chancellor Angela Merkel brokered with the Social Democrats (SPD) on Wednesday involves her handing over more than she originally intended to secure a fourth term in office. The resulting alliance may be better for the European Union than the political parties that are hooking up.
Trump's ex-lawyer Cohen to return before U.S. Congress on March 6,South Africa’s good vibes are undergoing a stress test. The rand has appreciated nearly 14 percent against the U.S. dollar since mid-December and 10-year government bond yields have fallen more than 80 basis points because of growing optimism that Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as president of the ruling African National Congress would usher in brighter economic prospects. But a furore around a state of the nation speech gives investors reason to temper their enthusiasm.
U.S. Senate weighs blocking Trump's border emergency gambit,"Alibaba's reunion with Ant Financial is heartening. The reshuffle, unveiled late last week, sees Jack Ma's $474 billion e-commerce goliath take 33 percent of the financial technology group. That simplifies the duo's relationship, draws a line under a controversy, and heralds a likely flotation."
Arsenal manager's weak second half instructs CEOs,"Walt Disney’s decision to recast itself as Netflix with theme parks looks scary. The House of Mouse is set to assimilate $52 billion of Twenty-First Century Fox's assets. Chief Executive Bob Iger also has to steady ESPN, deal with declining TV networks and potential ""Star Wars"" fatigue while building video-streaming products to reach viewers directly."
Review: How to deprogram economic xenophobia,"Credit Suisse’s reputation is taking a knock from a shock surge in global stock market volatility. The value of an exchange-traded fund set up by the Swiss bank to benefit from calm markets has collapsed due to recent turbulence. While the financial damage to Credit Suisse is minimal, it’s an unwelcome reminder of past mistakes. The reputational fallout could be more severe."
Japan would take turn for worse without Abe,"Democrats, anticipating a sprawling 2020 presidential field, are planning to hold prime-time debates in June and July on back-to-back evenings to make room for as many as 20 candidates."
Viewsroom: Fintech’s growing pains,"Europe’s recovering economy can help BNP Paribas clear a low return bar. Aiming for a return on equity of 10 percent – roughly in line with the French bank’s cost of capital – over the next two years might suggest a lack of ambition. Crucially, however, the target also looks achievable at a time when many rivals appear unable to escape from single-digit returns."
P&G drug deal needs vitamin shot to persuade Peltz,Jack Ma just landed a supporting role in a financial thriller. The e-commerce titan he leads is buying a $750 million stake in a cinema chain owned by Dalian Wanda. It should help improve the picture at tycoon Wang Jianlin's troubled conglomerate and might even bolster its ambitions to unite film production with theatres.
Wynn tosses female directors into boardroom brawl,President Donald Trump may regret attaching himself so closely to the stock market. U.S. indexes fell over 4 percent on Monday and share-price volatility at one point surged to a seven-year high. A breather – at a minimum – was overdue after a record run.
Cuba rings changes while trying to stay the same,"The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is scoring too low on transparency. The watchdog is dialing back its probe of the $15 billion Equifax's massive data breach last year. Mick Mulvaney, Donald Trump’s CFPB head, says the regulator has “pushed the envelope” too far in the past. Perhaps – but if protecting vital data of the kind hacked at the U.S. credit-scoring firm isn’t its remit, he needs to explain what is."
Hadas: Knowledge is better shared than patented,"The recent stock-market rout couldn't have caught most Breakingviews readers off guard. Even before the S&P 500 Index lost nearly 5 percent of its value in five days, surveys of participants conducted at ""Predictions 2018"" events held in eight financial centers over the past two months pointed to something of a consensus: equity investors were already too exuberant. Where they differ, however, is on what it will take to shake stock prices from their lofty posit"
Morgan Stanley hands investors volatility challenge,"Banks’ caution over bitcoin reveals a double standard in the treatment of crypto-currencies. Lloyds Banking Group has imposed restrictions on the unregulated electronic money, banning UK customers from using credit cards to buy bitcoin and other tokens. Protecting borrowers from potential losses is wise, as is the desire to avoid future fines from regulators. It makes financial markets’ rush to embrace bitcoin trading all the more jarring.  "
China/Russia oil hug can dodge Huarong curveball,"San Miguel has an alcohol problem. The Philippine conglomerate run by billionaire Ramon Ang is consolidating its beer and liquor businesses with its Manila-listed producer of meat, poultry and feed. A complex share swap suggests the enlarged San Miguel Pure Foods would be worth some $9.1 billion. It trades at a discount, however."
Impeachment decoded: A look at how to remove a U.S. president,"John Cryan is “not yet satisfied” with Deutsche Bank’s results, following a third consecutive annual net loss. He can say that again. Last month’s profit warning meant investors knew what was coming, but Deutsche still managed to give them an unpleasant surprise."
A scorecard of key players in U.S. special counsel Russia probe,"Vietnam's Thatcherism could do with fewer Hanoi characteristics. The sale of a 20 percent slug of state-controlled electricity provider PV Power is the country's latest successful privatisation. Stake sales are going gangbusters, as is the local stock market. That makes it easy to refrain from enacting deeper reforms, but they would help sustain the momentum."
U.S. Senate confirms Trump's pick to run EPA,"Apple has long followed Mies van der Rohe’s design precept that “less is more.” Now it’s doing the same financially. The company sold fewer iPhones for more money in the last quarter, it reported on Thursday. That raises fears that the company is losing its innovation edge. But that’s OK – persuading customers to pay more arguably requires as much genius as getting people to adopt the technology in the first place."
China’s new unemployment measure has big job ahead,Senator Elizabeth Warren issued a pointed campaign finance challenge to fellow Democratic U.S. presidential contenders at her official 2020 White House election launch.
Review: Comey is flawed champion of civics revival,"JPMorgan’s chairman and CEO intends to lead the bank until around 2023. Dimon has built a strong and successful company over the past 12 years. But the longer he stays, the harder it becomes to leave on an unambiguous high. Plus: Asian governments tackle bitcoin."
Starbucks’ anti-racism coffee break sets example,"Has Saudi Aramco landed on a cunning plan to boost its future stock-market valuation? Certainly, the $2 trillion valuation desired by the kingdom’s crown prince in the oil producer’s forthcoming initial public offering is hard to square with reality. A new partnership with the owner of Google may provoke some outside-the-box thinking."
Cox: Belt and Road paving way to worrying excess,"Blackstone is proving it knows more and more ways to make money. A surge in fee-related earnings helped the manager of $434 billion in alternative assets top expectations in the fourth quarter of 2017. With longer-term funds increasingly smoothing out the lumpiness of buyout gains, the outfit’s stock might start to get more love from investors."
Marcus gives Goldman some much-needed buzz,"Shell is entering a sweet spot. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant is starting to generate a large amount of cash after a couple of lean years. Just as well, given the crossroads at which the biggest energy companies stand."
China's two-track money policy hangs over economy,"China's IPO cleanup is off to an encouraging start. Regulators are rejecting more subpar applications; in January they turned down a record six applicants in a single day, including one by the country's largest private psychiatric hospital group. Tougher issuance standards could lead to broader reforms, plus help clear a massive backlog of aspiring issuers. Empowering bureaucrats even more is an acceptable short-term trade-off."
Netflix’s advantage is Facebook’s weakness,"When Mark Zuckerberg worries, investors should listen. The Facebook founder and chief executive has been flagging for months that ad revenue was set to slow. Now, tweaks designed to make the social network less divisive are hindering engagement and stifling user growth. Facebook has rarely disappointed investors; this could be the year."
BofA highlights bank shareholders’ luxury problem,Bond market tightening will complicate Jerome Powell’s task. U.S. Treasury yields rose to near four-year highs even as the Federal Reserve left policy unchanged at Janet Yellen’s last meeting. But a fresh growth spurt and worsening deficit outlook will pose a serious challenge for her successor.
Russia’s banks could once more be its airbag,Sometimes companies need chief executives who are visionary geniuses. Sometimes more mundane skills are required. Tesla’s plan to hand Elon Musk as much as $60 billion in stock over 10 years shows the electric-car maker is confused about what sort of boss is appropriate.
Singapore ruling gives Uber deal yellow light,"Donald Trump’s policy agenda is starting to stick to the script, even if the U.S. president himself doesn’t always. Trump’s first State of the Union address on Tuesday touched on immigration and infrastructure, but the speech contained few surprises and avoided some divisive pet topics. A consistent policy platform is emerging from the noise."
U.S. congressman allied with Trump under scrutiny for tweet to Michael Cohen,"“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” says Berkshire Hathaway boss Warren Buffett. That’s why his conglomerate, Amazon.com and JPMorgan are getting together to cut healthcare costs. Details are few and obstacles many, but the three firms bring relevant skills and a lot of employees to the mix."
Republican senator opposes Trump EPA pick over climate change,"The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a resolution that would end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the war in Yemen, as many lawmakers sought to push President Donald Trump to toughen his policy toward the kingdom."
Cohen: Trump feared audit if he released tax returns,"The UK government’s latest leak will nudge the country towards a softer Brexit. State papers reportedly show the country will lose in every scenario after it leaves the European Union. Sadly for anti-Brexiteers, the upshot looks like a less abrupt schism than a wholesale U-turn."
Sorrell’s messy exit could put WPP in play,"China's tech giants are keeping tycoon Wang Jianlin's relisting dream alive. A consortium led by Tencent will pay $5.4 billion for a stake in Dalian Wanda Group's indebted property arm. The investment buys Wang time to execute a promised Shanghai relisting, and the new alliance could help clear regulatory hurdles too. What the new backers will get out of it is less clear."
Review: America's founding was all about the money,"JAB and its partners are taking a gulp from 3G Capital’s fountain. They’re merging Keurig Green Mountain, the coffee-pod outfit it took private in 2016 for $14 billion, with publicly traded Dr Pepper Snapple. It’s reminiscent of how the Warren Buffett-backed architects of Kraft Heinz operate."
Breakingviews- Retiring Macau mogul had first-mover disadvantage,"The Davos bubble is prone to emitting dubious conclusions. Each January, the policymakers, business leaders, financiers, and various hangers-on who gather in the Swiss mountain resort offer up a snapshot of elite thinking. This “Davos consensus” often proves wide of the mark."
Instagram might want to unfriend Facebook,"Commonwealth Bank of Australia has made a brazen choice for the top job. On Monday, the country’s top lender picked retail head Matt Comyn as the next chief executive, despite a money-laundering scandal in his unit. Investors seem sanguine and CBA’s board argues the bank would be hard for an outsider to master quickly. Even so, the lack of accountability is disappointing."
IAG picks good time to ride Norwegian jet stream,"Who knew trade wars were so complicated? A U.S. trade agency on Friday surprisingly rejected calls by the $205 billion aerospace giant and the Trump administration to impose duties on Bombardier's C Series jet. It shifts the regional-airplane dogfight back to the marketplace, where it belongs, upping the pressure on Boeing to seal a tricky merger with Embraer."
Apollo’s Greyhound bet looks past UK politics,"Donald Trump surprised Davos. After a week of anticipation and a parade of world leaders at the World Economic Forum, the U.S. president laid out in unexpectedly statesmanlike fashion the most succinct and persuasive version yet of his ""America First"" ideas. Though the substance was familiar – that America is no longer keen to underwrite an economic order without reciprocity from other countries – its sober and inclusive tone was new."
Toys R Us Asia deal will be far from child’s play,"As part of a series of events marking the publication of the annual Breakingviews Predictions book, a panel convened in Hong Kong on Jan. 9 spent time debating the autonomous Chinese territory's plan to open the door to dual-class share structures."
Hadas: Even Trump can't make graft great again,"Hong Kong’s plan to welcome super-voting stock weakens corporate governance, but its appeal to Chinese tech companies also may be exaggerated. Officials from Credit Suisse, BlackRock, PCCW Media and Bain Capital debated the upcoming changes at a recent Breakingviews event."
Busting EU sport cartel lines already fat pockets,It’s never good to bring a knife to a gunfight. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Thursday took a potshot at the United States for flouting an international agreement to avoid currency manipulation. But he has limited scope to resist a stronger euro. And European politicians who take up cudgels may escalate a brawl they will lose.
China’s financial market door only opens inward,"The chief executives of Apple Inc, Walmart Inc, IBM Corp and other major companies are joining a Trump administration advisory board that hopes to prepare U.S. workers to deal with job training issues and the worforce shift brought by artificial intelligence and automation, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday."
Cohen warns Republican lawmakers: don't protect Trump,"The U.S. president seems to be trying to right past trade wrongs. But business has long since moved on, meaning tariffs on washing machines and solar panels will do more harm than good. Also, Merkel and Modi disappoint in snow-ravaged Davos. Plus: Spotify’s Wall Street snub."
Cohen: Trump ordered him to make 500 threats over 10 years,"The Presidents Club scandal increasingly looks like a tipping point. The 30-year-old charity has been forced to close because of fallout from a men-only event attended by businessmen at which female hostesses were groped and harassed. The furore will eventually subside, but justified public outrage should catalyse boardroom reform."
Cohen says prosecutors in NY investigating other possible illegal acts involving Trump,Rupert Murdoch’s next foe in his battle for Sky may be hedge funds. The tycoon’s Twenty-First Century Fox should be able to win regulatory approval to buy the 61 percent it doesn’t own of the pay-TV group. But holdouts could attempt to sink the deal unless they get a higher price.
HSBC donates top banker to China’s soft power push,SoftBank’s debt wizards have found new ingredients to chuck in their finance cauldron. A report that they might raise funds against semiconductor subsidiary ARM or a newly purchased 15 percent stake in Uber sounds entirely plausible: the hyperactive Japanese group does whatever possible to maximise financial firepower.
Washington zeroes in on correct Facebook target,"Customers rarely complain that prices are too low. Mostly they just take pleasure in getting a bargain. If they bother to think about it, they probably assume there must be some good industrial reason for any discount, such as better technology or economies of scale."
"Viewsroom: The biggest loser, China or the U.S.?","UK Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to punish groups that fail to protect retirement benefits, like collapsed outsourcer Carillion. New tools could include fining companies or curbing payouts. But the regulator can do more with the powers it already has to make companies fill gaps."
Trump trade war risks European carmaker backfire,"Leshi's perfect storm is blowing ill winds across the Chinese tech industry. Hubris, margin loans and starry-eyed investors have led to a cash crunch at the $9 billion video-streaming and smart-TV business of embattled LeEco. The company is now chasing founder Jia Yueting, branded ""China's Steve Jobs,"" for money he owes it. Bad behaviours that converged here will turn up elsewhere in due course."
Bayer investors get unwelcome antitrust present,"Canadian officials are eager to keep alive the North American Free Trade Agreement. And if they fail, there’s an insurance policy. Even though a U.S. pullout would affect Canadian exports amounting to nearly 20 percent of the country’s GDP, Ottawa has other trade pacts in the works, and a flexible currency would help cushion any blow."
Xi throws the trade ball back into Trump’s court,"Davos is having its #MeToo moment. For the first time, the annual World Economic Forum summit in the mountain Swiss ski resort is being chaired entirely by women. Gender is a theme of high-level panel discussions and cocktail parties, like one hosted by JPMorgan that encourages invitees to bring along a member of the fairer sex or a male advocate for women. It’s a conscious attempt to redress the low female attendance at the gathering of rich and powe"
Facebook not Zuckerberg is under fire in D.C.,"Britain’s competition regulator delivered a blow to Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday, but he’s still in the game. Twenty-First Century Fox’s 11.7 billion pound bid for Sky would give the 86-year-old mogul too much control over UK news, the antitrust authorities said. The deal could nevertheless go ahead."
Rail strikes will test French appetite for Europe,"John Dingell, a gruff Michigan Democrat who entered the U.S. House of Representatives in 1955 to finish his late father's term and became a legislative heavyweight and longest-serving member of Congress, died on Thursday. He was 92."
Breakdown: China’s gift to big technology,"President Donald Trump is slapping tariffs on solar panels and cells imported into the United States. The levies should ease pressure on surviving panel makers, but pricier imports will set back most of the sector. It’s an illustration of how difficult righting past trade unfairness can be."
New Deutsche Bank CEO fails to fill strategic void,"Netflix is pouring money into what is fast becoming a formidable competitive moat. The $95 billion video-streaming service run by Reed Hastings ended 2017 with negative free cash flow of $2 billion, based on figures released on Monday. Even so, it probably has more subscribers than rivals Hulu and Amazon combined. A hefty content budget is a risk, but ensures only the most deep-pocketed media firms can take Netflix on."
Trump's ex-fixer Cohen says he is keen to tell his story in public,"Fresh from successfully gaining a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble, the biggest proxy fight in corporate American history, the founder and CEO of Trian Fund Management sat down for a discussion at Times Square on how investors can better engage with, and improve, the companies they own."
U.S. denied tens of thousands more visas in 2018 due to travel ban: data,"The fourth season of The Celebrity Apprentice is chockablock with historic highlights of the American reality television genre. There's the catty exchange where Omarosa Manigault, who recently departed as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, schools La Toya Jackson, sister of the King of Pop, on the art of management: ""Being disrespectful is not good leadership – look it up, take notes."""
Two black women advance to runoff in tight Chicago mayor race,"Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech a year ago to the elites gathered in Davos was hailed as a new era in global leadership. Yet little changed in the following months. With U.S. President Donald Trump attending this year, it’s worth remembering that promises to the crowd at the annual World Economic Forum shindig in the Swiss ski resort are often less than they seem."
Russian stocks deliver sanctions face-palm moment,"The U.S. president heads to the Swiss Alps confab that’s the antithesis of his “America First” ideology. He’ll have competition: keynote speaker Narendra Modi, with his “Make in India” policy. Plus: BlackRock’s Larry Fink pushes social activism. And why Ford is stalling."
Review: The ultimate truth about blockchain,Tax cuts are looking like a rare win for Donald Trump. The U.S. president’s first anniversary in the White House on Saturday coincides with a possible federal funding hiatus. Slashing corporate taxes was a Republican success. But the shutdown wrangling is indicative of the partisan deadlock to come.
Wanted: candidates for Europe’s toughest bank job,"“For the purposes of this book ...‘the economy’ and ‘GDP’ are interchangeable terms.” The footnote on the first page of “The Growth Delusion” is a bit misleading. David Pilling’s intention is to demonstrate that even though maximising Gross Domestic Product has become the standard definition of national economic success, GDP is actually far from interchangeable with the actual economy."
HNA takes circuitous route to streamlining,Nestlé is making its board more activist-friendly. The chief executives of Adidas and Spain’s Inditex are among the heavyweight non-executive directors that the Swiss giant is proposing to appoint. Their e-commerce expertise will help steer efforts to sell more directly to consumers. They may also help to pre-empt any plan by activist Dan Loeb to install his own candidates.
Viewsroom: Spotify leads Wall Street on IPO dance,"Chinese electric-vehicle battery-maker CATL boasts a fully charged valuation. To live up to it, the company needs to power up abroad. Many Chinese champions stall overseas – but this one might not. A $2 billion initial public offering will help."
Chinese visitors can hit nerve tariffs don’t reach,"The U.S. House Financial Services committee has postponed a hearing planned for Tuesday on the use of U.S. sanctions against countries such as North Korea, Iran, Russia and Venezuela, the panel said, citing scheduling issues."
Mark Zuckerberg could learn from Jamie Dimon,"Amazon has disrupted great swaths of the U.S. retailing landscape, but it’s choosing not to break the mold with its second headquarters. The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Dallas, Atlanta and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots."
Disarming move gives BlackRock one more weapon,"Carillion’s demise isn’t good for many people, but it will likely help Jeremy Corbyn. Since his election in 2015, the leader of the UK opposition Labour party has long called for state investment in public infrastructure. The Carillion mess and ongoing work from the National Audit Office will give him momentum."
Quest for central bank transparency has limits,"The economic recovery in 2017 is feeding complacency among Chinese officials. Yet while overseas money pours into stocks and bonds, this cash doesn't boost efficiency the way long-term foreign direct investment does - and China remains highly inefficient."
Hadas: Monopsony money,"Tim Cook is going as American as Apple’s pie. The iPhone maker will pay $38 billion in tax on its huge pile of overseas cash. It’s also aping Amazon with plans to open a second U.S. campus, invest $30 billion over five years and create 20,000 jobs."
U.S. disrupted Russian trolls on day of November election: report,"Why did Donald Trump say some places are “shithole countries”? Racism and xenophobia are obvious answers, but something else might be influencing the U.S. president: the pessimism of Thomas Malthus."
Top strategists split from Bernie Sanders for his 2020 White House run,The UK government is worried Interserve will follow Carillion into oblivion. A similar threat in the banking sector would surely prompt the state to deploy familiar tools to contain contagion. But the government’s dual role as client and bailout-wary market promoter complicates matters in the construction and support-services sectors.
U.S. senator seeks to shoot down Trump bid to ease small arms exports,"Uber's next ride-share could be in Southeast Asia. After struggling in China and Russia, the app operator swapped its businesses there for a stake in Didi and a joint venture with Yandex. Another sensible partner would be Grab, which shares a backer in SoftBank."
Cox: Sinclair is more totalitarian than democratic,Nestlé is parting ways with LaffyTaffy and Runts. The Swiss food group agreed on Tuesday to sell its U.S. candy brands to Italy’s Ferrero for a sweet $2.8 billion to invest in products with better growth prospects than junk food. But high valuations for alternatives like vitamin pills limit new boss Mark Schneider’s opportunities to make Nestlé a clean-living champion.
SoftBank's less risky Swiss Re bet is still silly,"General Electric's profligate past is haunting its future. A fresh $6.2 billion post-tax charge relating to reinsurance – a business the company exited over a decade ago – shows the challenge of managing a conglomerate. As Chief Executive John Flannery struggles to reshape the $163 billion outfit, it’s another reason to consider a breakup."
Elliott targets right pressure points at Hyundai,"JD.com's switch in logistics stacks up. The Chinese online retailer is raising $2 billion to fund its warehousing and delivery unit, Reuters reported on Monday. This sensible burden-sharing brings JD and rival Alibaba's business models closer together."
Spotify and its direct listing win popular vote,"The Trump administration threatened on Monday to veto an effort in the U.S. Congress to end U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the war in Yemen, continuing a stand-off with lawmakers over policy toward the kingdom."
Disney and Fox open door to higher Sky bid,"Carillion’s pension hole is a wake-up call for UK companies and their banks. The construction firm, which went into liquidation on Monday, last year estimated the shortfall in its retirement fund at 587 million pounds. That liability has now been transferred to Britain’s Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which reckons the deficit is nearer 900 million pounds. That’s bad news for Carillion’s creditors – and an omen for companies with similar obligations."
Harbour closes in on $10 bln Santos at a price,"Shareholders are leaving Auto 2.0 in the hard shoulder. As the industry gathers in Detroit for its annual confab, carmakers are revving up their plans for the next generation of vehicles. Ford on Sunday said it's more than doubling its electric battery investment to more than $11 billion by 2022. A day earlier, General Motors revealed it had asked regulators to approve its driverless car. Toyota, Volkswagen and others are tanking up, too. Investors, though, aren"
Spotify direct listing piles risks upon risks,"The collapse of Carillion is a stress test for the UK authorities’ faith in outsourcing. The troubled construction firm has gone into liquidation after failing to secure fresh funding. The government was right not bail out one of its key suppliers. Nevertheless, a messy cleanup will raise multiple questions about the risks in handing state work to private contractors."
Viewsroom: Facebook’s multiplying problems,"A mobile float might be a smart call by Japan’s SoftBank Group. A separate listing for the company's domestic telecoms business could unlock fresh funds for boss Masayoshi Son, prod the unit into better performance, and shrink the “conglomerate discount” applied to the parent’s shares."
Barclays settlement fixes one of several headaches,Mark Zuckerberg is discovering the cost of factory-farming Facebook’s users. The $550 billion social network’s success harvesting advertising dollars through mass-appeal content has made it very profitable. The snag is that users are increasingly unhappy. The founder and chief executive’s return to focusing more on their welfare may limit short-run earnings but should improve sustainability.
Facebook’s size is its other looming problem,"It is probably borderline blasphemous, if not contractually forbidden, for any member of the American press to criticize “The Post,” Steven Spielberg's cinematic retelling of how the Washington Post managed to catch up to the New York Times, defy the government and publish the Pentagon Papers. The message of the film, which the director scrambled to put together following Donald Trump’s rise to the U.S. presidency, couldn't be clearer: A functioning democracy r"
Manafort asks judge for sentence far below the maximum: court filing,Financial markets have started doing European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s job for him. The euro hit three-year highs and government bond yields rose after euro zone rate-setters hinted they may change their tune on how long monetary policy will stay ultra-loose. These market moves amount to a tightening of monetary conditions. That buys Draghi some time to phase out negative rates that are increasingly at odds with accelerating growth.
Wisconsin governor pulls troops from U.S.-Mexico border,"Fast Retailing is heating up. First-quarter figures offer fresh confirmation of the turnaround at the Japanese retailer behind Uniqlo - and show all those reasonably priced puffer jackets and light weight sweaters have generated a cash pile that now exceeds $7 billion. If Fast Retailing does not share more of the wealth, troublemakers could emerge, however."
Lawsuit accuses Trump of kissing campaign worker without her consent,"Walmart’s new pay hike, purportedly inspired by the recent cut in the U.S. corporate tax rate, is a little less than real largesse. The U.S. supermarket chain’s extra spending on hourly wages is just a sliver of what it could save in tax, though – and a tight labor market is likely to have been a more potent driver."
Breakingviews- Chinese food-to-flights app offers half-baked IPO,"Talk of buying fewer of Uncle Sam’s bonds may be Beijing’s way of showing some teeth as the Trump administration mulls import tariffs. But as with other retaliatory trade tactics, it would hurt China too. Plus, why Nelson Peltz doesn’t want to be called an activist investor."
Rocket-fueled stocks finally feel the burn,"Virginia's embattled governor insisted he would not resign over a racist yearbook photo, but said the state's lieutenant governor would have to step aside if sexual assault allegations against him were found to be true."
Kim Jong Un's change of heart might be for real,"Marks & Spencer is looking a bit dowdy. The high street retailer’s food and clothing arms met quarterly forecasts, but both have strategic issues. This wouldn’t matter if M&S was seeing 25 percent growth in online sales, like jazzier rival Boohoo. But a 5 percent share dip on Jan. 11 can partly be attributed to the fact it isn’t."
Hadas: Populist economics can be sensible,"China must choose between globalizing its currency and increasing its influence over oil prices. A yuan crude futures contract could finally launch in Shanghai early this year, as China tries to shake up trade dominated by London and New York. A new benchmark is within reach, but a clear-cut market success requires the unthinkable: embracing the dollar."
UK gender pay gap requires “just do it” approach,"Activist investors deployed a record $62 billion campaigning for corporate change in 2017, according to Lazard – more than double the amount a year earlier. They’ll still be at it this year, and among possible targets could be Wells Fargo and Under Armour, according to two informal Breakingviews polls on Tuesday."
Chinese banks healthy enough for stronger medicine,"Jack Ma is warming to Hong Kong as a listing venue. The billionaire founder of Alibaba says he will consider listing subsidiaries of his Chinese e-commerce giant in the city. This suggests the local exchange’s push to attract more technology firms, both by allowing super-voting stock and more secondary listings by U.S.-traded firms, is working. The corporate-governance ramifications could be ugly."
Cox: A beneficent billionaire should buy Remington,"Foodies saved Christmas at Sainsbury’s. The supermarket’s grocery business had a better festive season than its clothing and general merchandise. UK consumers, stung by high inflation, are spending less on non-essential items, but still need to eat. That means grocers are better able to pass on rising prices to shoppers."
Mukesh Ambani’s music deal could get a remix,"What do you get when you cross the feverish world of crypto-currencies and a faded industrial icon desperate for a new lease on life? The answer, provided Tuesday by Eastman Kodak, is KodakCoin."
Breakingviews- Uber races towards IPO with Southeast Asian deal,"It’s easy enough to identify bitcoin and its ilk as being caught up in a speculative mania. A more difficult and important question is whether crypto-currencies have any future as money. In a world where the stability of conventional currencies is threatened globally by the vast expansion of central-bank balance sheets, high government indebtedness and the myriad ill consequences of ultra-low interest rates, it would be nice to believe this was the case. Yet bitc"
The Exchange: CDP’s water boss,Germany’s biggest trade union and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi share a common cause. The former wants a big pay rise for industrial workers in Europe’s largest economy. The latter wants euro zone wage growth to pick up so that he can stop worrying about inflation being too low. Teutonic workers have a strong hand but may still disappoint Draghi.
Pro-Trump political group launches ad campaign to back border emergency declaration,"Samsung Electronics is ending its stellar year on a slightly worrisome note. Forecast quarterly sales and operating profit from South Korea's $327 billion tech behemoth, while still strong, fell short of expectations. Falling memory chip prices are making investors anxious, and hint at a tougher 2018."
Senator Warren swears off expensive campaign fundraisers,"The tech backlash has caught up to Apple. Jana Partners and CalSTRS want the $900 bln company to give parents better controls over their kids’ iPhones. It’s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets."
U.S. Democrats seek ways to counter Trump's economic message,"The United States is holding direct communications with members of Venezuela's military urging them to abandon President Nicolas Maduro and is also preparing new sanctions aimed at increasing pressure on him, a senior White House official said."
Dropbox stores good news for tech IPOs,"Britain’s shopaholics are an increasingly shaky economic backstop. Spending on Visa cards in 2017 was the weakest in five years, while profit warnings from retailers Mothercare and Debenhams add to the gloomy outlook. Despite easing cost inflation and a tighter job market, customers who have kept the UK economy moving are becoming less reliable."
China bond-index debut a timely counter to tariffs,"The Trump administration has an understandable beef with South Korea. A trade pact struck back in 2011 didn't live up to expectations. As talks kick off to amend the deal, though, there will be an unusually difficult balancing act to strike."
Guest View: Why the government will lose to AT&T,"Rupert Murdoch can keep his New Year celebrations going. Fresh from his $52.4 billion deal with Walt Disney, the media mogul may be a major beneficiary of a new book about dysfunction in President Donald Trump’s White House. The exposé is ripping apart the alliance between the president and his erstwhile aide and Breitbart News boss Steve Bannon."
Review: Pluralist economics is a work in progress,"Opponents of the euro are rearing their heads again, this time in Italy. Matteo Salvini, leader of the country’s anti-immigration Northern League party, has reiterated his opposition to the single currency. Growing Italian discontent with the European Union could help to make the issue a vote-winner in elections planned for March 4. Despite a widespread economic revival, monetary union remains a political target."
Facebook crisis could bust digital-ad duopoly,"Investors in Chinese bonds should prepare for a nasty surprise in 2018. Beijing’s tolerance for off-balance sheet municipal borrowing has faded as debt levels have exploded. In the name of repricing risk, regulators will allow the once-unthinkable: a big default by a local government financing vehicle."
Steve Wynn's casinos make best of bad hand,"More government borrowing and less central bank buying will force bondholders to fend for themselves, Breakingviews predicts. Plus, passive funds will force out a CEO, electric vehicles give gasoline cars a run for their money and soccer clubs’ spending splurge will intensify."
Stars align for Mark Carney to raise rates again,"Stocks are proving they can rally on U.S. markets regardless of whether government bond yields rise or fall. But over the past 30 years, the two have never risen in tandem for more than four consecutive quarters. If that pattern holds, either equities or yields will slide within six months. It’s more likely to be equities."
Self-driving cars may find legal lesson in pharma,"Tech groups like Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet are attracting increasing political heat for their dominance of markets like e-commerce, social media and web search. But a recently discovered security flaw in chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM highlights another important concern: bugs potentially affecting hardware found in the majority of computing devices."
Chancellor: Index investment riskier than it looks,"The global market for oil enters 2018 susceptible to price-hiking geopolitical shocks. Unrest in Iran, which now looks to be dissipating, was an early contender. The next event – U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential rethinking of a 2015 agreement to relax sanctions on the Islamic Republic – is more likely to cause waves."
Viewsroom: China’s new central banker,Losing Alibaba's 2014 listing to New York was embarrassing for a city that has thrived connecting China to world markets. Hong Kong could go some way to making up for this in 2018.
"North Carolina judge rules voter ID, tax cap amendments unconstitutional","U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will voice concerns about the growing presence of China's Huawei Technologies in central Europe when he visits Hungary, Slovakia and Poland next week, a senior U.S. official said on Friday as Washington tries to bolster ties with a region it acknowledges it has neglected."
"Trump administration denying, delaying more foreign skilled-worker requests","Much of the stock market's recent boom resided in an acronym: FAANG, for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, aka Alphabet. As important as they've become, investors tired of this trade can look forward in 2018 to a new set of letters to jumble into a more exciting investment thesis. Call it SLAW."
Trump administration bans abortion referrals at U.S.-funded clinics,Bitcoin was a hot topic at this year’s seasonal parties. Financially ignorant people asked what is going on. The most authoritative answers often came from those with little previous interest in investment. It is a familiar pattern.
How Washington could really fix trade with China,"A merry runup to Christmas may delay Next’s much-needed style overhaul. The British clothing retailer is more upbeat about the outlook for full-year profit. But healthier sales and diminishing price pressures may allow Chief Executive Simon Wolfson to dodge tough decisions, such as much-needed store closures."
Zuckerberg’s slow defense reveals real weakness,"Europe’s market big bang offers clear pain for a fuzzy gain. The overhaul of financial rules bundled in the European Union’s MiFID II directive is designed to make finance fairer and safer. But that laudable aim comes at a heavy cost, with an unrealistic deadline, and may open up new regulatory loopholes."
U.S. rate hike risks global fallout,"To sustain its march on the United States, Ant Financial may have to take some China-like steps. Jack Ma's digital-payments business must rethink its global strategy after U.S. authorities torpedoed a plan to buy MoneyGram International. Even a newly touted alliance between the two companies is at risk."
Hadas: Taking on the Chinese new world order,"Jack Ma made early friends with Donald Trump. He visited the U.S. president-elect almost a year ago to tout how his e-commerce giant, Alibaba, could help small American businesses create 1 million new jobs. Now, though, Ma’s Ant Financial offshoot has failed to secure approval for its $1.2 billion purchase of cash-transfer outfit MoneyGram International."
Time for Germany to make Deutsche/Commerz happen,"The golden age of TV programming is heading for a grisly finale. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are on course to boost their spending on new shows and movies at a faster clip than the growth of the overall video-streaming market. Consolidation among traditional media groups is only adding to the frenzy. Something will have to give."
James Packer's exit deals Crown a better hand,"It’s a sunny spring day and Italians are waking up to a new legislature. None of the country’s political parties has won enough seats in the previous day’s election to safely control parliament, yet each claims victory. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement earned the largest number of votes, Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and its Northern League ally form the biggest political group, while the centre-left Democratic Party secured the most parliamentary seats.

Cox: Dual-class buyers’ early remorse at Facebook,"There is plenty of discord and uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump’s second year starts. Yet money is cheap, the global economy is motoring, and markets are ebullient. That combustible mixture could be called ""froth and frustration."" How this ironic social contrast, worthy of Jane Austen, resolves itself will be key for 2018."
Europe’s data tax war is worthy but hard to win,"Carl Icahn has won his first battle with SandRidge Energy, but the war is not yet over. The oil driller has dropped its $746 million bid for rival Bonanza Creek Energy, something the activist and others wanted. But its poison pill – which bars Icahn from upping his stake and makes a takeover more difficult – remains in place."
Cox: Dual-class buyers’ early remorse at Facebook,U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal.
China's regulatory mega-merger howls for synergies,"America is great at finding natural gas, but not so good at using it. A boom in production has made the country a net exporter of the fuel. But consumers are on pace to have used less electricity generated from gas in 2017 than they did a year earlier. Shale’s promises of “energy independence” are bumping up against policy and infrastructure obstacles."
New York pursuing charges against Manafort whether or not Trump pardons him: source,"Goldman Sachs is going to lose on the swings but gain on the roundabouts as a result of President Donald Trump’s tax reforms. The Wall Street firm will book a $5 billion charge in the fourth quarter, it said on Thursday, two-thirds of it from a new levy on the $31 billion or so earnings it holds abroad. Yet that should be more than offset by other goodies, notably a significantly lower corporate tax rate."
Trump says will leave a small number of U.S. troops in Syria,"Companies that sweep settlements for bad behavior under the carpet will feel shareholder ire in 2018, Breakingviews predicts. Plus, Apple will float past the EU’s roving eye, splintering political parties are a ticking U.S. time bomb and bank bosses may hang up their hats."
Trump says he would veto measure blocking emergency declaration,"Soccer fans have found a topic as contentious as refereeing decisions: eye-watering transfer fees. The 222 million euros that Paris St Germain paid Barcelona for Brazilian star Neymar in August - a sum described by Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger as “beyond rationality” - may not be surpassed in 2018. Nonetheless, clubs will have good reason to open their cheque books even wider."
Facebook gives members one more reason to leave,"When it comes to Chinese acquisitions in European soccer and vice versa, the score is $3 billion-nil. A string of investments in storied clubs, from Atletico Madrid to AC Milan, stopped abruptly when Beijing put its foot down in 2017. The Abu Dhabi- and Chinese-owned group behind Manchester City could be the first heavyweight to bet the other way."
Brexit transition deal buys little but time,"Apple and Saudi Arabia’s partnership may test out their comfort zones. The country's large population and income make it logical that the smartphone giant is in talks to open a shop, as Reuters reported on Thursday. Enticing a cutting-edge global tech firm would also gloss Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s modernizing campaign. There are risks for both; Saudi’s gamble may be bigger."
Zuckerberg is making a worrying passel of enemies,The “Brexit and British Politics” author explains how last year’s vote to leave the EU became the UK’s defining political issue. He says longer-term political undercurrents helped tip the balance towards Leave – and will dictate the type of Brexit the country ends up with.
Holding: Courts may toss investors a crypto-curve,"China's ""mixed-ownership"" policy push will put more private capital into lumbering state-owned enterprises in 2018. Beijing wants cash and expertise from the private sector to upgrade SOEs, many of them heavily in debt. The private companies concerned will take comfort that cooperation could reduce political risk. But for the broader reform agenda, half-measures will likely be worse than none at all."
Viewsroom: How long should a leader lead?,"A ministerial demotion is set to upend the Chinese property market. President Xi Jinping is preparing to sidestep traditional policy shops, such as the Ministry of Finance, to put decision-making into the hands of a smaller group of individuals. One consequence will be an accelerated push to pass a national property tax."
Li Ka-shing's exit ushers in new era for tycoons,"Having just delivered Corporate America its biggest legislative gift ever in the form of sweeping tax cuts, it's only natural that U.S. House Speaker and self-described fiscal geek Paul Ryan might want to consider his next gig. The Wisconsin native's wonkiness wins out over his schmoozer credentials, making a high-profile job on Wall Street or as a K Street lobbyist an unlikely fit. But as this imaginary letter from a potential corporate recruiter suggests, a"

Cox: Aramco and Amazon encourage bad behavior,"Catalonia’s local elections on Thursday delivered no Christmas joy. Parties seeking to break with Spain won a majority of seats in the Catalan parliament. Their support didn’t strengthen, but it didn’t really weaken either. That suggests a fraught new year too."

Senator Elizabeth Warren backs reparations for black Americans,The cut in the U.S. headline rate of corporation tax from 35 percent to 21 percent is a windfall. But to whom? Some companies say they will share the wealth with workers and communities. But there’s less to these claims than meets the eye.
Trump administration ends California talks on auto emissions: White House,"Activists could stir things up in the business of luxury. Family control allows high-end fashion brands to hoard cash and live with second-rate governance. But assertive investors are becoming more willing to take them on, while some companies, like Prada, are more vulnerable than they appear."
"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals defends $375,000 drug price after Bernie Sanders rebuke","Asahi is sobering up a bit when it comes to dealmaking. Late on Wednesday, the Japanese brewer said it would sell the roughly one-fifth it owns of Chinese counterpart Tsingtao for about 106 billion yen ($937 million). The near-decade-long bet has not been time or money well spent but at least this shows Asahi will now focus on investments where it can wield meaningful control."
UK’s best Russian riposte is hiding in plain sight,"Will Amazon choose New Jersey's largest city as the location for its second headquarters? That's what hometown native Baraka is hoping - and he's lobbying hard to make it happen, even trying to cajole neighboring New York City to play a role in swaying the e-commerce juggernaut's decision. "
Blackstone’s Schwarzman schools CIC on art of deal,"Is Wall Street more democratic than America? As crazy as it may sound, the slapdash process by which the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress just shoehorned a corporate tax cut masquerading as comprehensive tax reform through the legislature raises the question. The bill effectively redistributes income from the most productive states in a fashion that potentially undermines faith in representative democracy."
Apple acquires goodwill of flag-waving publishers,The U.S. tax reforms passed by Congress on Wednesday are effectively a giant bet that benefits given to companies and the wealthy will trickle down to average workers. That makes them a big risk for the Republicans who control Congress. Here are five factors to measure the policy’s success.

Death of Broadcom's bid leaves worrying fog,The world is headed for a year of smooth economic sailing. How smooth depends on U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The best thing that a duo who steer one-third of the planet’s GDP can do for growth is nothing.
German energy carve-up generates good sparks,"Bitcoin has found unlikely allies in Asia: regulators. Japan and South Korea now make up some half of global trading in the $300 billion market. Tokyo has officially recognised bitcoin and crypto-currency exchanges, and Seoul is mulling the same. Such regulation is an effort to contain risk but also encourages acceptance and increases the allure of this untouchable cash. "
UBS stands to lose more than IPO fees in Hong Kong,"A political doomsday is approaching in the United States. Republican and Democratic parties will splinter ahead of the 2018 midterm election, marginalizing moderates. More firebrand politicians increases the chances of government shutdowns, a U.S. debt default and trade wars. The economy would be collateral damage."
Review: The flimsy finances behind China's miracle,"The African National Congress is getting change at the top. But South Africa’s turnaround will come only slowly. The ANC, dominant since the first post-apartheid elections in 1994, chose Cyril Ramaphosa to lead the party. That hints at an end to the rampant corruption and economic decline under President Jacob Zuma. Yet the victory was narrow, and reform could be endangered by infighting and much-needed fiscal rigour."
China courts tech and Taiwan with Foxconn IPO,"Investors will keep the pressure on corporate Japan to change. On top of governance trouble, like the strategic and accounting errors that nearly killed Toshiba, have come revelations of dodgy quality-control at firms such as Mitsubishi Materials and Toray.

Justice Department preparing to receive Mueller report: CNN,"Every week is infrastructure week, the wags in Washington say.

House Democrats move to block Trump's emergency declaration on border,"Ryanair investors are expecting a higher-cost future – but it may become more expensive than they think. They have knocked over 2 billion euros off the budget airline’s market value since it caved in to pilots and recognised unions on Friday. That’s more than the extra staff outlays may be worth. If easyJet is a guide, though, the $18 billion Ryanair will have to go further."
Trump's former lawyer Cohen gets two-month delay to report to prison,"Thales is riding to the rescue of French jobs at Gemalto. The defence firm has trumped Atos’ tilt at the world’s biggest maker of chips for mobile phone SIM cards. The $4.8 billion agreed deal brings modest returns and leaves Thales exposed to a struggling payments business. The buyer’s biggest shareholder, France’s government, may still be happy."
Viewsroom: Trump slaps tariff fear on markets,"Donald Trump’s diagnosis of China's threat to America's economic health is still missing a remedy. In his latest complaint, the U.S. president will slam Beijing’s rising financial might as a national security threat. It may signal coming tariffs related to intellectual property and other issues. At the same time, aides say they need China’s help on North Korea. It doesn't mesh."
Viewsroom: Trump slaps tariff fear on markets,"China’s shared bikes are ready to merge into the car lane. A slew of two-wheeled ventures have exhausted investor cash and municipal patience. Left standing will be market leaders Mobike and Ofo, both valued at over $1 billion. Instead of uniting in 2018, though, they will tie up with the likes of taxi app Didi Chuxing."

Abertis rethink would avoid bidder roadkill,"It’s easy to forget that, until recently, Britain’s relationship with Europe was of little concern to most voters. A month before the 1997 general election, pollster Ipsos MORI asked Britons to name the issues that would decide which party they voted for. Less than a quarter mentioned the European Union. Its salience fell to 14 percent in 2001 and lingered in the single digits for more than a decade. So how did the 2016 referendum lead to the highest turnout in a"
Asia's boardrooms require critical mass of women,"A chastened Tianjin-based property developer is laying the foundation to build a better balance sheet. Sunac China Holdings plans to raise $1 billion by selling discounted shares. Thanks to a 380 percent rise in the company's share price over the last 12 months, it's a good time to tap the market for cash. Given how aggressive Chairman Sun Hongbin has been, though, he probably will need to do so again."
Trump tariffs risk more than just a new trade war,"How bad will the Republican tax plan be for New York City? Alicia Glen, who looks after economic development for America's largest city, says it will hit 700,000 taxpayers and depress property values.

It is paying $52.4 billion in stock to own a slimmed-down Twenty-First Century Fox, including the movie studio and a 39 percent stake in Sky. It’s a historic deal for media mogul Rupert Murdoch – and it should erase the discount afflicting his long-suffering shareholders."
Cohn exit makes White House chaos markets’ problem,A South African giant has come to Lonmin’s rescue. Gold miner Sibanye-Stillwater has offered to buy the troubled platinum specialist for shares worth 246 mln pounds. The offer is far from generous when compared with available cost savings. But Lonmin’s financial woes and inability to raise equity make a share of a larger group look attractive.
Trump plans to nominate Jeffrey Rosen as Justice Dept. No. 2: senior official,"Tencent's healthcare push shows symptoms of hubris. China's $480 billion social-media and gaming giant has rapidly and quietly expanded into the sector, where apps linking patients to doctors and other health services are booming. The business opportunity helping upgrade the country’s inefficient medical system is real, but competition is fierce and online models are unproven. "
Illinois mass shooting reveals gaps in gun laws; state seeks to close them,"Alabama voters ended up putting their anger before economics. Democrat Doug Jones won the U.S. state’s Senate race on Tuesday in a stunning upset. Rival Roy Moore has unique troubles, but President Donald Trump’s approval has also fallen, despite Alabama’s decreasing jobless rate this year."
Bernie Sanders seeks U.S. presidency again in 2020,"Disney's chief Mouseketeer is about to face his biggest test. The $160 billion media conglomerate is close to striking a deal to acquire parts of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire, pegged at $60 billion by CNBC. Some are an odd fit and regulators may not like Disney expanding in sports and movies. Boss Bob Iger has his work cut out."
Trade tensions curb spirits in U.S. energy sector,President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expected a formal announcement as early as next week that the coalition fighting Islamic State rebels has reclaimed all of the territory previously held by the extremist group.
Election leaves Italy with only radical options,Two Spanish ministries are interfering in Italy-based Atlantia’s 16.5 billion euro takeover bid for local toll-road group Abertis. France and Italy similarly meddled in recent deals within the European Union. Building scale inside the bloc isn’t proving entirely borderless.
U.S. simplifies Qualcomm decision by complex means,"Bubbles aren’t just about the madness of crowds - nor are they simply manifestations of excess liquidity and leverage. But both of these factors are present in the extraordinary rise of bitcoin over recent months. Every spectacular bubble involves a premonition of the future. The trouble is that they turn out to be deeply flawed premonitions. In this respect, bitcoin has much in common with great historic speculative manias."
Protest vote is big winner in Italy’s election,The Steinhoff controversy could be a chance for the European Central Bank to rethink its bond-buying programme. The institution is facing a possible loss after acquiring the South African retailer’s debt as part of its so-called quantitative easing. The ECB could reduce the chances of a repeat.
China’s economic targets invite promise fatigue,"Mukesh Ambani looks set to preside over India’s first $100 billion-plus company. The tycoon’s Reliance Industries is likely to attain a twelve-digit market capitalisation in 2018. His refineries may be at the mercy of oil prices but Ambani’s bid to dominate Indians’ digital lives could earn his unconventional empire a more Silicon Valley-style valuation. A mooted 2019 listing of his upstart telecom operator, Jio, will add to the upward momentum."
BlackRock puts gun-complex boards in crosshairs,"Exxon Mobil’s climate-change U-turn deserves some wary investor cheers. The $350 billion oil firm is finally planning to comply with shareholder demands – approved more than six months ago - to disclose how global warming will affect its business. That’s to be welcomed. But Exxon’s reputation for fobbing off such concerns means investors need to not just trust, but verify."
Review: Some economic ideas do get old,"The Bank of England may have to change its tune on inflation. UK prices rose 3.1 percent in the year to November, the fastest pace in six years. The central bank blames Brexit and says the pace of price increases is near peaking. That’s a bit too convenient, with further interest-rate hikes a risk to sluggish economic growth."
China techie’s $47 bln trade leaves arbs in shade,"Just before Thanksgiving, the families of 10 victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting came closer to something like justice than they have in the nearly five years since 20 children and six educators were murdered in their classrooms. They had their day before Connecticut's Supreme Court, which agreed to consider their contention that the maker of the AR-15 rifle used in the tragedy could be held liable for the killings."
China techie’s $47 bln trade leaves arbs in shade,"Buying $25 billion worth of malls is mere retail therapy. Westfield, the global piece of an empire started back in 1960 by Australian magnate Frank Lowy, is selling itself to European commercial property group Unibail-Rodamco. The combined company will be a tangled mess and merger savings are scant. Given consumer trends, getting bigger may be a temporary mood enhancer."
Viewsroom: Fraud puts India's lenders on edge,"A last-minute activist attack on Toshiba could be good for investors. Argyle Street Management argues the Japanese conglomerate need not follow through on an $18 billion leveraged buyout of its NAND flash-memory business. The Hong Kong hedge-fund manager has a solid case. While an immediate halt is unlikely, a later U-turn is both possible and desirable."
Ginsburg gets back to business in return to U.S. Supreme Court,"Donald Trump’s rhetoric against the World Trade Organization hurts America first. The U.S. president is no friend to the global trade body, which is hunkering down for its biennial confab. Reforms are needed but America has won most of its complaints, including against China."
U.S. states sue Trump administration in showdown over border wall funds,"Testimony by U.S. President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen before the House Intelligence Committee has been postponed until Feb. 28, the panel said on Wednesday, the latest snag over an appearance by Trump's one-time ""fixer."""
Vice President Pence picks familiar face for chief of staff,"Bitcoin action is now available without the bitcoin. CBOE Global Markets launched its futures on the crypto-currency late on Sunday. It opens fresh avenues for trading, but for now the new contracts have little utility beyond speculation."
Cox: How to rid your portfolio of assault weapons,"A plan to move the Bank of England out of London defies financial gravity. Britain’s opposition Labour party says it may move parts of the central bank to Birmingham. That may appeal to voters, but both the BBC and HSBC have found relocating out of the capital expensive and difficult. The idea also ignores the reason London exerts such a strong pull."
WPP raises spectre of adland stagnation,"Uber's entire business has been predicated on flooring it right at the establishment. Co-founder Travis Kalanick once said his company was in a campaign where ""the incumbent is an asshole called taxi."" New boss Dara Khosrowshahi just pulled a U-turn in Singapore by striking a deal with ComfortDelGro, the powerful local cab operator."
China’s war on tycoons intensifies,"Bart Chilton wants to marry digital dreams with regulated reality. The former commissioner of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is teaming with a group including a former TPG executive to launch a crypto-currency backed by oil. His promise of stable value sits oddly against bitcoin’s wild ride. While the vehicle offers a tax edge over oil-backed exchange-traded funds, it’s hard to imagine this coin existing if not for the wider craze."
Which gunmaker will exit assault rifles first?,The president of Yes California leads a campaign arguing that the Golden State should become an independent country - an idea increasingly referred to as Calexit. He explains why secession would be good for the state’s economy and how he’ll get the rest of the nation to buy in.
McCall’s next job: show ITV has a future,Brexit is rapidly becoming a symbol without substance. Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-minute deal with the European Union reduces the chances of a chaotic divorce but exposes the difficulty of preserving trade flows after the separation. A lengthy transition period will create further scope for May – or another Prime Minister – to make concessions.
Miners face a multi-billion dollar growth debate,"South Korea’s corporate tax increase is a contrarian one. The consensus from Washington to Tokyo is that lower levies stimulate innovation and job growth. Yet President Moon Jae-in’s move to crank up taxes on the highest-earning companies makes eminent sense. Asia’s fourth-largest economy is so unbalanced, it needs socialist redistribution to transform its capitalism."
Georgia gives Amazon one great reason to stay away,"Bitcoin’s meteoric rise is looking like speeded-up unicorn hype. A sheen of futurism, fear of missing out, a lack of fundamental value, and an inability of big backers to sell without crashing the market are factors pumping up the digital currency’s price."
Murdoch holds winning hand in Sky poker game,"The ebbing of fossil fuels is sapping energy from GE - and beyond. The conglomerate is laying off 12,000 people in a power division that lights up 30 percent of the world. It blamed overcapacity amid a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. But other divisions are closely tied to fossil fuels, too. Its troubles suggest a wider shakeout is in the offing."
Comcast’s $31 bln Sky bid spoils Disney-Fox party,"A $20 billion accounting loss can be a good thing, when the company in question is Citigroup. The mega-lender’s woes during last decade's financial crisis helped make ""writedown"" a household word. Now the $200 billion colossus may take another whopping great hit. This time the potential loss, sparked by planned U.S. tax cuts, is actually pretty helpful."
Alibaba delivery deal could be tasty side dish,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday will use his State of the Union address to the U.S. Congress to call for revamping the country's immigration laws, according to excerpts released by the White House."
Presidents Day protests decry Trump's emergency declaration,Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini is bagging $500 million from selling the insurance company to drugstore chain CVS – despite only a middling performance as boss. Behind such healthcare mergers: a desire to cut out a surfeit of middlemen.
Official cites 'unlawful' balloting in U.S. congressional vote,"In some parts of the financial market, it’s as if the euro zone debt crisis never happened. The gap between benchmark French and German bond yields this week shrank to its smallest since 2009, before the countries that share the single currency were hit by financial shocks that threatened monetary union itself. Such indiscrimination is premature, and stores up fresh problems."
Exclusive: Air Force to push Congress for military housing tenant bill of rights,"Bookmakers adjust the odds to make sure they can make money whatever happens. GVC’s 3.9 billion pound bid for Ladbrokes Coral Group is trying to do something similar, by using financial engineering to hedge the risk of a government clampdown on its target’s business."
Alibaba delivery deal could be tasty side dish,"Walgreens Boots Alliance is positioning itself for future healthy growth in China. On Wednesday, the U.S. drugstore chain said it would pay $416 million for 40 percent of Shanghai-headquartered peer GuoDa. A sensible shake-up of drug distribution and sales by Beijing is spurring consolidation and giving pharmacies a stronger hand. This deal gives Walgreens market insight and could be a springboard for more investment."
Hadas: Billy Graham's great missed economic chance,"The Force could be with a Walt Disney deal for Twenty-First Century Fox. The Magic Kingdom is getting close to buying parts of Rupert Murdoch’s $60 billion empire, according to news reports. Disney would add to its clout with global outlets and cable content. The Murdoch family, meanwhile, may fancy shares in a bigger group. A deal could help with succession problems at both companies, too."
Corbyn turns soft Brexit into hard politics,Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren make odd antitrust bedfellows. The liberal U.S. senator says mega-deals like Aetna’s $77 billion sale to CVS could kill competition. She also backs the Justice Department’s fight against AT&T-Time Warner and has concerns about past merger remedies. It puts her in the same camp as the president.
Latvian bank failure raises 8 bln euro question,The American debate about lowering taxes on corporate profit teaches an important lesson about the contemporary economy. It does not work in the way introductory economics courses say it should.
Xi’s open-ended rule bodes ill for governance,"Dalian Wanda Group’s moves to reduce leverage have won reprieve from officials, not absolution. On Dec. 4, subsidiary Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties agreed to sell a 65 percent stake in the Hong Kong-listed Wanda Hotel Development to a company wholly owned by founder Wang Jianlin. That will provide much-needed liquidity to pay down offshore loans, but the group will probably sell more foreign assets to buy its way out of Beijing’s penalty box."
Buffett generational shift applies to investors too,"Obfuscation offers the only hope of a breakthrough in deadlocked Brexit talks. A plan for Northern Ireland to comply with some European Union rules after the United Kingdom leaves the bloc has met with opposition in Belfast and demands for similar treatment elsewhere. Prime Minister Theresa May’s best hope is to fudge tough decisions, and use the threat of a chaotic exit – or another election – to quash dissent."
Cox: Gun lobby meets match with economic protests,"In psychology, disassociation is a common reaction to childhood trauma. Deutsche Asset Management can be forgiven for wanting to put some distance between itself and parent Deutsche Bank after suffering 38 billion euros in asset outflows last year as a result of the German lender’s ordeal. By rebranding itself ahead of an expected IPO, however, the group that oversees 711 billion euros perversely highlights its current owner’s blemishes."
RBS is a step away from ending its lost decade,"Top U.S. officials said on Tuesday that foreign actors did not have a significant impact on computer systems and other equipment underpinning the November 2018 congressional elections, despite reports of hacking attempts."
Anbang seizure flips script on Chinese takeovers,"Jack Ma is pedaling headlong into China's troubled bicycle-sharing sector. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial just hedged its investment in Ofo with a $300 million stake in Shanghai-listed Youon. That's another 80 million potential users for its Alipay system. The move reflects rising stakes in a cutthroat battle with Mobike, backed by payments rival Tencent."
Kardashian slap shows hole in Snap’s accounting,Facebook is launching a messaging app for kids under 12. It’s a bid to attract a new generation of users by a company struggling to lure youngsters from Snapchat. Yet it’s also a political gamble for the $500 billion social-networking site.
Ex-congressman Weiner released from prison after sexting scandal,"A rushed U.S. tax bill showers goodies on parts of corporate America. The Republican Senate plan snuck in tax breaks for oil and gas partnerships, real-estate investment trusts and other sectors. One hiccup, though, puts the research and development tax credit favored by business at risk."
Acting Pentagon chief not decided yet on funding border wall,"Over-the-counter drugs could pose health risks for investors in consumer groups. Germany’s Merck has invited bids for its Seven Seas vitamins unit, while Pfizer is selling its more consumer-focused business. Nestlé and rivals see opportunities to apply their sharper marketing skills. But pumped-up valuations suggest the health drive will be expensive."
Trump's choice for U.N. ambassador withdraws: State Department,"CVS Health just revealed the high cost of defending against Amazon. The U.S. drugstore chain and pharmacy-benefits manager is shelling out $77 billion, including debt, to buy insurer Aetna. In time, sending more patients to in-store clinics could lift profit. The plan, however, is more apt to simply stop existing customers from leaving."
Viewsroom: Chipmaker battle fries M&A circuits,"The debate over bankers’ pay is back with a vengeance in Britain. In one corner stands UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti, who suggested that criticism of high remuneration is driven by envy. On the other, leader of the opposition Labour party Jeremy Corbyn, who ramped up attacks on bankers after a sell-side analyst criticised his policies. The row shows the enduring costs of bank excess."
Too-big-to-fail rules are too sound to scrap,"The modern economy is an intangible economy. In “Capitalism without Capital”, economics professor Jonathan Haskel and policy advisor Stian Westlake deliver an important and thought-provoking account of why this matters. They show how current policies are inadequate to tackle emerging social and economic challenges. But the book falls short of addressing the pressing issue of how to rein in dominant tech companies like Facebook and Google."
Barclays throws money at its many problems,"Global giants are looking at Vietnam through beer goggles. The young, hops-happy economy is alluring for big brewers like Asahi and Anheuser-Busch InBev. Traditional markets are as dull as a flat pint. But entrenched interests, tech-like multiples and the mixed experiences of early entrants should caution them to enjoy responsibly."
Westfield's $15 bln sale is dangerously discounted,"Saudi Arabia needs OPEC cuts to work, but not too well. The oil cartel agreed to extend cuts to production until the end of 2018 on Thursday. Its moderation so far has drained inventories and lifted prices. Further cuts won’t boost prices to the point where Saudi’s budget is in balance. Then again, that gives Saudi’s young crown prince a reason to continue reforms."
Hadas: Put stock markets in their modest place,"Donald Trump has staked his political colors to the mast of a rising stock market like no other U.S. president. He regularly argues at home and abroad that the increase in equity prices since his election in November 2016 validates his business-friendly policies and overall stewardship of the economy. What he doesn't mention is that much of the rest of the world's bourses actually outperformed America's in dollar terms, which is what matters to U.S. voters."
Thrift can steer Lloyds to profitable banality,"Senator Lindsey Graham said on Monday if President Donald Trump declares an emergency to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border it could provoke a war in the Republican party, and urged fellow Republicans to back the ""commander-in-chief."""
Revived Santos can turn from prey to predator,"The Daily Mail is finally succumbing to the media industry’s malaise. After years of defying gravity while rival publishers watched circulation and revenue crash, the right-wing tabloid’s parent company expects its media business to shrink next year. That complicates boss Paul Zwillenberg’s plan to show that Daily Mail and General Trust is more than a struggling publisher."
Stuffed KFC only has itself to blame,"Rio Tinto holds a valuable card in a high-stakes game. As Freeport-McMoRan hammers out terms for handing over a majority stake in the Grasberg copper mine to Jakarta, a production arrangement dating back to 1995 gives its Anglo-Australian partner an effective veto. The best way to play this sleeved ace would be to negotiate a graceful exit."
Gulliver exits HSBC with nearly full scorecard,"Bitcoin is in danger of becoming something like respectable. The CME Group plans to start trading futures in the crypto-currency, treating it like a genuine asset with a vaguely predictable value. Devotees are delighted, and critics, like me, look foolish. I predicted imminent collapse back in 2013 when the price was $87. On Wednesday, it hit $10,000."
Foxconn is manufacturing a higher value in China,Britain is playing a weak hand badly in the Brexit poker game. The country has reportedly bowed to European Union demands that it pay up to 100 billion euros when it leaves the bloc. The outcome of months of haggling shows the UK has a lot less leverage than it pretends.
U.S. judge issues gag order in trial of former Trump adviser Stone,"U.S. President Donald Trump is back from his China visit, but the afterglow of his bromance with counterpart Xi Jinping has faded fast. Unimpressed with progress on North Korea and market opening, the White House has moved aggressively to target aluminium dumping. This is just an opening salvo in what looks set to be an acrimonious renegotiation of the world's most important trade relationship."
Mueller says searches yielded evidence of Stone-WikiLeaks communications,"U.S. President Donald Trump is back from his China visit, but the afterglow of his bromance with counterpart Xi Jinping has faded fast. Unimpressed with progress on North Korea and market opening, the White House has moved aggressively to target aluminium dumping. This is just an opening salvo in what looks set to be an acrimonious renegotiation of the world's most important trade relationship."
Trump to nominate Jeffrey Byard as U.S. emergency management chief,"U.S. President Donald Trump is back from his China visit, but the afterglow of his bromance with counterpart Xi Jinping has faded fast. Unimpressed with progress on North Korea and market opening, the White House has moved aggressively to target aluminium dumping. This is just an opening salvo in what looks set to be an acrimonious renegotiation of the world's most important trade relationship."
How Corbyn could grab British water at little cost,"Despite some media pundits’ suspicions to the contrary, David and Charles Koch may be cooking up nothing more than a decent investment in publisher Meredith. Through Koch Industries’ private-equity arm, the Republican-leaning activist U.S. billionaires are sinking $650 million into Meredith to help it buy Time Inc for $2.8 billion including debt. The Kochs get preferred shares, but no votes or board seats. Like Carlos Slim’s loan to the New York Times, the pote"
Wall Street turns CEO pay into snowboard cross,"The Bank of England has given an unwitting boost to UK Chancellor Philip Hammond. Last week, Hammond said he wanted to raise 15 billion pounds to meet fiscal targets by selling the state’s 71 percent holding in Royal Bank of Scotland. His job has been made easier by the fact that the BoE awarded the bank a clean bill of health in its stress tests."
Bank of Japan’s Kuroda bags a tricky second term,"Uber's early backers are on a collision course with their own greed. Japan’s SoftBank and allied investors want to buy roughly one-sixth of the bumptious ride-hailing firm. Existing owners can sell at a $48 billion valuation, or about 30 percent below the last one. Even with a markdown, they could make many times their money. The promise of more, however risky, will cloud the thinking."
Cox: Wall Street's antisocial role in selling guns,"Virginia Governor Ralph Northam apologized on Friday for a photograph in his 1984 medical school yearbook showing him and another person in racist garb at a party, but said he would serve out his term even as pressure piled on from fellow Democrats for him to step down."
Viewsroom: Volatility puts investors to the test,"Britain’s post-Brexit industrial plan is short of ambition. The government has promised to boost research spending, improve teaching of mathematics, and upgrade infrastructure. Even if the country was not breaking from its largest partner, however, the goals would lack oomph."
German politics has become Europe's weak link,"The leadership row at the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau won’t stop its inevitable gutting. It’s unclear who’s in charge at the agency. Richard Cordray, the departing Barack Obama-appointed director, named his temporary successor, as did the White House, provoking an unusual legal fight."
"Asia spotlight gives Credit Suisse gleam, not glow",Boris Collardi is bowing out of Julius Baer at the peak. The whizzkid of Swiss private banking is leaving the $13 billion group for smaller rival Pictet after eight years in charge. Bold deals and aggressive expansion in Asia boosted earnings and lifted the wealth manager’s shares to record highs. Replicating such achievements will be harder.
Hadas: Renewed growth tests old economic theories,"Time beat the clock. After rejecting at least two earlier entreaties, the publisher of Fortune, Sports Illustrated and other magazines agreed to be acquired by rival Meredith for $1.8 billion, which includes a hefty 46 percent premium. It’s a lucky break because a go-it-alone strategy looked doomed. Bountiful cost savings, however, will go to the buyer and its new billionaire backers."
Sky and BT impose unusual austerity on UK soccer,Bankers’ long wish list for rule changes starts in the weeds. Executives have plenty of regulations they want a more industry-friendly Federal Reserve to overhaul. But for many the top target is an obscure supervisory letter that has turned often minor infractions into roadblocks for everything from new branches to M&A.
Baidu follows right script with video spinoff,"It’s easier for an activist to oppose than propose. That’s the straightforward lesson from Clariant’s struggle with its largest investor, White Tale. The 20 percent shareholder scuppered the Swiss chemicals maker’s merger with U.S. rival Huntsman. Determining what happens next, however, will require powers of persuasion."
"After Auschwitz visit, Pence accuses Iran of Nazi-like anti-Semitism","It is time to start worrying about Chinese bonds. Tightening regulation has provoked a sharp selloff in the $9 trillion fixed-income market, with collateral damage to share. If stress is sustained, it could infect China’s giant pile of foreign-currency debt."
"Trump, in proclamation, says military help needed due to 'gravity' of emergency","“The needy nations grow more destitute, while the rich nations become even richer.” When Pope Paul VI wrote that in 1967, the leader of the Catholic Church was expressing the era’s conventional wisdom. The pope then begged all people of goodwill, poor and rich alike, to change the situation. Much of his prayer has been granted."
"Trump makes his case for Nobel Peace Prize, complains he'll never get it","The British government’s Royal Bank of Scotland sale looks priced for a messy Brexit. Chancellor Philip Hammond intends to raise 15 billion pounds to meet fiscal targets by selling the state’s holding in the UK lender. He could achieve that even if RBS shares tumble 30 percent, Breakingviews calculates."
South Africa is nearer redemption than it looks,CEFC China Energy will aggravate Western paranoia over Beijing's investment intentions. The private company came out of nowhere to buy a $9.1 billion stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft - the sort of deal once reserved for state energy champions. It has raised eyebrows by trying to invest in U.S. brokerage Cowen. Now Reuters reports the enigmatic firm might bid for Time Warner's stake in a central European media group. The company is acting as if it has a permi
HNA sale sets stage for a great escape,"U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who gained national prominence in the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, announced on Friday that he would seek the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election, injecting more youthful energy into the expanding Democratic field."
Trump budget is mostly fan fiction for Republicans,"The longtime Asia bull and Quantum Fund co-founder thinks the worst bear market of his lifetime is coming. He swung by our Hong Kong bureau to discuss the risks, as well as Trump’s Asia tour and why America could become its own worst enemy if it lets China dominate the region."
Heineken’s number two status brings marginal costs,"
Procter still digs in with Peltz,
With hubris but nothing much else.
Insularity remains,
Causing new corporate stains,
As the board waits for fresh Trian welts.

It isn’t that Peltz pushed too hard:
The campaign started without much petard. 
He sought simply a seat. 
But was met with conceit
From an entrenched group of clubby blowhards.

State Bank of India picks right time to pivot,"Travis Kalanick has a lot to answer for at Uber Technologies. Sure, he founded the revolutionary ride-hailing service and built it into a global business. But the legacy of irresponsibility while he served as chief executive has cast a shadow over the company’s future."
Uber’s Waymo deal recasts existential question,Philip Hammond is struggling with his Brexit straitjacket. Britain’s chancellor announced giveaways to homebuyers and the health service in his autumn budget. But bleak growth forecasts and the economic drag caused by leaving the European Union severely limit his generosity.
Market turmoil increases the attraction of cash,"Nippon Paint’s run at Axalta looks less than brilliant. The $11 billion Japanese company has lobbed in a cash bid for its U.S. rival, according to Reuters, killing the target’s merger talks with Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands. A deal valued at some $12 billion including debt, even assuming hefty savings, would destroy value. Fulfilling global ambitions may be costly."
Korea can aim for Olympic economic bronze,President Donald Trump’s administration is scrambling media signals. The Department of Justice on Monday sued to block AT&T’s merger with Time Warner over concerns the two will use content to stiff rivals. But another agency intends to scrap rules that force internet providers to treat web traffic equally.
Hadas: Brexit trial could go worse than expected,WPP has rebranded its Tokyo defence. The advertising conglomerate is selling into a $1.4 billion buyout it argued “significantly undervalues” its Japanese partner ADK. That reveals a weaker-than-billed negotiating position. One consolation could be re-investing in the Bain-led deal.
The Exchange: Italy's finance boss,"BYD’s stock almost doubled this year as China accelerated its electric vehicle drive. Chairman Wang Chuanfu is targeting revenue of 1 trillion by around 2025. Yet earnings at the Warren Buffett-backed carmaker are flagging, and the road looks crowded with rivals. To outpace them, BYD could return to its roots."
"Trump set to declare border emergency, sign shutdown-averting bill","Randall Stephenson is going to war. The AT&T chief executive is fighting the U.S. Department of Justice after it sued to block his $85 billion merger with Time Warner. Faced with similar opposition six years ago, Stephenson gave up a $39 billion tilt for T-Mobile US. Anything less than all-out victory this time would be fatal."
"Trump vows emergency declaration over wall, agrees to shutdown-averting bill","The market will trump politics on the future of TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline. Nebraska regulators’ green light for the controversial project is a victory for U.S. President Donald Trump, but it doesn’t guarantee the conduit’s construction. Years-long delays have let rivals steal a march while low prices sap drillers’ interest in the Canadian oil sands."
"Senate passes border security bill, sends to House","Russia is not prepared to restore confidence in the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Friday after the United States decided to suspend compliance with the accord."
Viewsroom: The Fed's belated Wells Fargo beating,"Robert Mugabe will cast a long shadow over Zimbabwe. The 93-year-old ruler, who is refusing to step down after the military seized power five days ago, is likely to be impeached after nearly four decades in power. He bequeaths an economy in dire need of reforms. The most important – luring back foreign investment and restoring trust in a dysfunctional currency system – will happen over years, not weeks."
Chancellor: Beware the volatility bubble's popping,"Good sometimes comes from bad. The collapse of German coalition talks on Monday, after the Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of discussions led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, definitely looks inauspicious. Prolonged political uncertainty in Europe’s biggest economy will delay reforms that would better protect the euro zone against the next downturn or crisis. But a wholesale revamp of the single currency area will in the end be easier if Merkel doesn’t have to pander"
Mark Carney's next rate rise rests on Theresa May,Alibaba's deal suggests grocery stores are queuing up to check out. The e-commerce goliath agreed to buy 36 percent of Chinese supermarket operator Sun Art Retail for $2.9 billion. To land the stake at a massive discount implies brick-and-mortar store owners see the writing on the wall.
Yum China looks appetising despite iffy pizza,"Latin America has battled dictators and demagogues. Its next adversary is lawlessness. As Michael Reid writes in ""Forgotten Continent: A History of the New Latin America,"" further steps toward prosperity depend on the region's willingness to embrace the rule of law and effective institutions – both of which are still lacking."
Elon Musk fiddles while Tesla burns,"The telecom firm’s acquisition of Time Warner, owner of CNN, may hit regulatory hurdles in D.C. President Trump’s caustic tweets against the news network look self-interested, but watchdogs could yet legitimately rethink norms of competition. Plus: GE searches for a way forward."
Europe is biggest winner of German coalition deal,Northern Ireland has become Brexit’s Gordian knot. Avoiding a hard border in the region is an aim of all sides in negotiations over Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. The least-worst fix is for Europe to treat Northern Ireland the way it does Norway. That’s only possible if pro-UK politicians in Belfast can be made to see the economic necessity. 
Zuma exit spat exposes South Africa reform hurdles,"Since June, when Amazon.com agreed to buy Whole Foods Market, Kroger, the largest publicly traded U.S. supermarket chain, has seen nearly $8 billion of its market value disappear. That is a testament to the Shiva-like force the e-commerce pioneer led by Jeff Bezos can unleash, threatening to destroy swaths of the retail landscape and many of its jobs."
Alibaba’s reunion with Ant Financial is heartening,Honesty is often touted as the best policy. It may be the hardest one for central bankers to adopt. Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane this week told a conference of global rate-setters to speak simply and truthfully to the general public. His advice is laudable but difficult to follow in its entirety.
Disney Netflix-with-theme-parks recast looks scary,"Scarcity value was on vivid display on Wednesday night at Christie’s in New York. The auction house sold Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” for $450 million to an unidentified telephone bidder, after hyping the 16th-century work with a weeks-long world tour. That price, more than four times Christie’s roughly $100 million estimate, makes it by far the most expensive piece of art ever sold at auction."
Volatility shock knocks Credit Suisse’s new image,"An accounting malfunction has thrown a wrench into hopes for GKN’s re-engineering. Chief executive-designate Kevin Cummings is leaving the UK-based car parts and aerospace group with immediate effect after it unearthed more audit problems in the aerospace unit he ran. The mess reinforces the case for breaking the company into two, but also delays any retooling."
Democratic debates could feature as many as 20 candidates,"U.S. President Donald Trump began the year with $19.2 million in campaign cash, a war chest that gives him a head start on Democrats lining up for the chance to run against the Republican in the 2020 White House race."
Trump's firing of FBI head Comey triggered probe: ex-official McCabe,"From Goldman Sachs partner to Fortress founder and now bitcoin trader, the chief executive of Galaxy Investment Partners has something of a Midas touch. He swings by Times Square to talk about how he's making a killing with a new hedge fund betting on crypto-currencies."
Pelosi threatens possible legal action over expected Trump emergency declaration,"In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the three-headed dog that prevented the dead from leaving the underworld. Investors in Deutsche Bank will hope its financial namesake’s arrival as a major shareholder in the troubled lender is a more positive omen. But any hopes of reviving a merger with rival Commerzbank, where Cerberus Capital Management already owns 5 percent, rest with bigger beasts – including the German government."
European economy can help BNP clear low return bar,"From Brexit to Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia, the world is full of surprises. But those cheering wrenching change may face further upsets. The UK rejoins the EU, the U.S. president discredits small government, and Saudis become poorer. The next shock may be the rise of dullness."
Wanda thriller casts Jack Ma in supporting role,"Zimbabwe is a country in need of change – dramatic perhaps, but not sudden. The takeover of the government by the army on Wednesday, shortly after President Robert Mugabe ousted his deputy, could be the beginning of a long journey towards solving the grave economic problems that blight the African nation. Too severe an upheaval could leave the country further adrift."
U.S. stock plunge is a welcome reality check,"President Donald Trump’s coal push is losing power as America goes green. An administration plan to subsidize solid fuels has stirred a backlash from industry, which fears it will distort power prices. Meanwhile U.S. carbon emissions from coal fell at a record pace in 2015. Environmental and economic forces are conspiring against the president’s campaign pledge."
CFPB scores too low on Equifax transparency,"A plan to hit U.S. startups with an extra tax would be better directed at private equity. Technology firms are understandably upset over a Senate plan to tax stock options and restricted stock units when they are vested. It would raise $13.4 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Ending a loophole on investment profit for buyout barons would bring in more."
Cox: Sliding stocks don’t surprise our readers,"Italy’s failure to qualify for soccer’s World Cup may be a national humiliation, but the country has other reasons to celebrate. Europe’s fourth-largest economy is growing at a rate not seen since before the sovereign debt crisis. The data confirms the euro zone recovery is getting stronger and broader."
Banks' crypto caution reveals double standards,"It doesn’t take much imagination at work to grasp the religious undertones in General Electric  boss John Flannery's plan for the $178 billion conglomerate. He says he is ""looking for the soul of the company again."" Now, some 100 days into the job, Flannery has categorically exorcised the ghosts of false expectations past by halving its dividend, reducing earnings guidance and questioning entire swaths of the company's portfolio of industrial assets"
San Miguel serves up an enticing spread,Vodafone is figuring out how to go it alone. The 58 billion pound mobile operator and cable group Liberty Global ended talks over a tie-up in 2015. The possibility of a deal hasn’t gone away. But an improving outlook and fibre-broadband growth plans in Germany and Britain make a combination with John Malone’s group – or anyone else – less urgent.
Deutsche Bank fails even to hurdle low bar,"A new Trans-Pacific Partnership is a big deal, even without the United States. Losing the world’s biggest economy seriously reduces the overall impact of the trade pact, which Donald Trump jettisoned at the start of his presidency. For Japan, Australia, Canada and others, however, it is valuable anyway, and over time the framework could expand. Breakingviews looks at how and why TPP stuck around."
Vietnam’s Thatcherism could use an extra push,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would either strike a very big trade deal with China or ""postpone"" it, but it was not clear precisely what he was referring to."
Apple’s less-is-more vibe bodes well for profit,"A new Trans-Pacific Partnership is a big deal, even without the United States.

Trump considers 60-day extension for China tariffs deadline: Bloomberg,Theresa May’s misery risks infecting the UK economy. The British Prime Minister faces growing challenges to her leadership from her Conservative party’s pro- and anti-European Union factions. Political disarray increases the risks that quitting the bloc will inflict serious harm on the economy. A softer Brexit is becoming harder to deliver.
Congress negotiators finish drafting border security bill: aide,Britain is the killjoy at the global defence party. Shares in Ultra Electronics fell by almost a fifth on Monday as the UK defence contractor warned of tight UK spending. Mid-market groups might face foreign invasions of their own.
Viewsroom: Jamie Dimon risks ruining a good run,"Japan’s largest lender is banking on an easier ride in Indonesia. Buying into Bank Danamon would nicely round out the regional presence of the $87 billion Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. And when it comes to both price and politics, MUFG looks better placed than the Southeast Asian group’s previous suitor."
Google offers Aramco unlikely route to IPO heaven,Equifax has suffered a new intrusion: into its profitability. Costs relating to the $13 billion U.S. consumer-credit scorer’s recent massive cyber breach helped knock earnings down 27 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Revenue also took a big hit. And the likely biggest expenses – including a long list of unquantified legal exposures – are yet to rain down.
Blackstone diversifies over time as well as space,"The chipmaker’s hostile tilt at Qualcomm is a rare aggressive move in the sector. Qualcomm has its own issues, awaiting approval for its NXP deal and fighting Apple in court. It all suggests the tech sector is too frothy. Plus: Is Hong Kong losing its moxie as a financial center?"
Shell is flush enough to afford mistakes,"The European Central Bank may have pushed its bad-loan cleanup too fast. The institution proposed stricter rules governing banks’ provisions for non-performing loans but overstepped its authority, the EU parliament’s legal service says, according to Reuters. The ECB is right to target European lenders’ 840 billion euro mountain of bad debt, but its clumsy move may end up slowing down its effort."
China's IPO cleanup makes encouraging debut,"China is letting outside investors join the front line in its war on debt. The government will let foreigners control financial-sector joint ventures, and says it will eliminate ownership caps completely in a few years. Western financiers have been burned by such promises before. But the $10 trillion in uninvested savings languishing in local banks, plus a burgeoning wealth management industry, should encourage experienced players to take a second swing."
Zuckerberg’s persistent warnings bear heeding,"Jack Ma is about to show off his new toys. China’s “Singles’ Day”, on Nov. 11, kicks off nearly a month of discounts and promotions. The extravaganza means lots of free PR and huge transaction volumes for Alibaba, his $480 billion behemoth. For investors, the stunts will also illustrate how supermarkets, augmented reality and mobile payments fit in Ma’s ""new retail"" strategy. "
Bond market tightening complicates Powell’s task,President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would let the Justice Department decide how to handle the special counsel's report on an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow.
Hadas: Tesla’s $60 billion mistake on pay,"Apple may anoint the winner of Broadcom's $105 billion bid for Qualcomm. A dispute over iPhone royalties left the U.S. chipmaker vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. Settling could preserve Qualcomm’s independence – but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to the handset maker, or just surlier."
Trump policy agenda starts to stick to the script,"Not many regulators get the celebrity treatment accorded Margrethe Vestager. The European commissioner for competition took the stage on Monday in front of a crowd of thousands. “Society is about people, and not about technology,” she said to raucous applause at Web Summit in Lisbon, an annual gathering that has become the closest thing to the technology industry's version of the Rebel Alliance from Star Wars."
U.S. healthcare bloat faces new triple threat,Burberry’s new boss is taking a big gamble on delayed gratification. Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti’s plans to take the British brand upmarket will mean no sales or operating margin growth for more than two years. Disappointed investors who lopped almost 1 billion pounds off Burberry’s market value on Thursday will now be unforgiving. Only flawless results and the right new designer will prevent a further slide in the share price.
U.S. House backs measure to end U.S. support for Saudis in Yemen war,"Prime Minister Najib Razak says his 2018 “mother of all budgets” will propel Malaysia into the ranks of the world’s top economies. Its $1.5 billion of handouts will enrich farmers, fishermen, rubber traders and other interests. In terms of upgrading competitiveness, it falls woefully short."
Democratic lawmakers say U.S. military action in Venezuela 'not an option',"Tencent and Snap have sent a short but effective message to Facebook. The owner of China's killer app WeChat now owns 12 percent of its struggling U.S. peer, whose Snapchat service is best known for the ability to make photos vanish. Even though the shares are non-voting, the two companies have excellent reasons to connect."
U.S. posts another budget deficit as tax revenues sag,"First everyday socks lost their charm, now it’s melt-in-the-middle chocolate puddings. British retailer Marks & Spencer will speed up closures of its clothing stores, aiming to move sales online. But the usually reliable food business is looking a bit off, too."
Brexit leak nudges UK towards softer withdrawal,"Hong Kong's listing market looks more Chinese every day. China Literature, the online publishing arm of mainland tech colossus Tencent, smashed the chandeliers in its $1.1 billion Hong Kong debut, soaring more than 80 percent in early trade on Wednesday. As local punters swarm into mainland tech, the new-issue market is starting to mimic distortions more common in Shanghai and Shenzhen. For the bourse operator, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, it's a good pro"
Chinese angels keep Wanda's IPO dream alive,Credibility is everything to an activist. That makes Tuesday’s defeat at ADP especially embarrassing for Bill Ackman. Fewer than one shareholder in four backed the Pershing Square boss’s bid for three seats on the payroll processor’s board.
JAB takes gulp from 3G with Keurig-Dr Pepper deal,Associated British Foods will pay for its sweet tooth. A company that sells everything from sugar beet to cheap party dresses has so far made the most of this somewhat odd mix. But its exposure to sugar prices means its valuation is too rich.
Beware the Davos bubble’s dubious emissions,"Tech fervour is buoying Hong Kong’s new-issue market. Investors have snapped up shares in Razer, a maker of keyboards and mice for gamers, and China Literature, the electronic publishing arm of locally listed heavyweight Tencent. That contrasts with signs of fatigue over initial public offerings in New York and London. Limited supply, particularly in tech, has helped keep the market healthy."
Australia’s CBA makes a brazen CEO choice,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday called U.S. intelligence chiefs ""extremely passive and naive"" on Iran and dismissed their assessments of the threat posed by North Korea a day after they contradicted his views during congressional testimony."
Boeing needs Embraer deal to fly after tariff crash,Netflix is pushing over-the-top thinking. Walt Disney may be mulling a bid for Rupert Murdoch’s film studio and cable networks. A deal would reduce Twenty-First Century Fox to news and sports assets while helping the Magic Kingdom bulk up to fight the video-streaming network.
"Trump reworks ""America First"" for the global elite","Chipmakers like Freescale Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors took a high-profile role in the leveraged-buyout binge that preceded the financial crisis – and the distress that followed it. That makes Broadcom’s roughly $105 billion unsolicited offer for Qualcomm on Monday all the more edgy. The borrowing associated with a deal, if it happens, could be in record amounts and may send debt-to-EBITDA ratios uncomfortably high."
Breakingviews: Super-voting stock returns a split-ticket,"Offshore financial secrecy is succumbing to the law of diminishing returns. A new dump of leaked documents, dubbed the Paradise Papers, shows the enduring popularity of opaque structures in low-tax centres such as Bermuda. But regulation that sheds light on such deals is getting tighter, while technology makes leaks more likely."
The Exchange: Dual-class dueling,"Qatar Airways has landed in the centre of the debate about Cathay Pacific’s future. The state-owned Middle Eastern carrier is buying nearly 10 percent of its struggling Hong Kong counterpart for about $661 million. That may not be a money-spinner for the Qataris, but it will certainly complicate any future manoeuvring over Cathay’s ownership."
Mario Draghi is ill-equipped for currency wars,"Not two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia's crown prince declared before thousands of his subjects and invited guests that his country needed to move to a more just, open and moderate Islamic society. On Sunday, Mohammed bin Salman turned the same venue – the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh – into a posh detention center for princes, ministers and other elites rounded up in a sudden anti-corruption drive. It could do the likely next Saudi king's ambitious economic and social refo"
"Apple, Walmart, IBM CEOs join White House advisory panel","Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has entered an alternate reality. The OPEC member's socialist leader wants to restructure the ailing country's foreign debt and has put an alleged drug trafficker in charge of working out how. U.S. sanctions make any refinancing virtually impossible. But even default might not force the hapless, increasingly authoritarian former bus driver from power."
House to vote on government funding bill late Thursday: lawmaker,"Blame for failed initial public offerings is spread widely and thinly. Two British companies pulled their planned London listings on Friday, following weak performances from other new stocks. At the same time, tycoon-controlled Russian energy group En+ priced its shares at the bottom of the offer range. The one thing still rising is the number of banks working on IPOs. That’s part of the problem."
Trump will likely sign government funding deal: source,Shinzo Abe will have to be on more than just his golf game this weekend when he meets with Donald Trump. The Japanese prime minister is hosting the U.S. president and they're slated to play at least another nine holes together. Abe would be wise to stay on the geopolitical fairway and out of the economic rough.
Viewsroom:  Trump solar tax is more burn than balm,Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has a $500 bln plan to attract new business to the oil-dependent kingdom: build a utopian society on the Red Sea free of many of Saudi’s legal and cultural constraints. Plus: why tech and finance execs won’t be joining President Trump in Asia.
City’s #MeToo moment is tipping point and catalyst,"Republicans’ botched pitch for tax cuts could cost them dearly. Their revised plan, unveiled on Thursday, only partly deals with earlier criticism that it benefits the rich. And the chief lieutenants responsible for selling it to the public for the White House - Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin - have fumbled their way through their own script."
Rupert Murdoch’s next foe: Sky hedge fund holdouts,"With the U.S. government shutdown over, Lila Johnson returns to work on Friday cleaning bathrooms as an employee of a federal contractor, but unlike those who work directly for the government, she is not getting any of the pay she lost during the month-long hiatus."
Uber plan highlights SoftBank's addiction to debt,Raising interest rates is typically a sign of economic strength. The Bank of England’s decision to increase official UK borrowing costs for the first time in a decade has a more dismal logic. Governor Mark Carney and his fellow rate-setters have concluded that leaving the European Union will permanently lower Britain’s growth prospects.
Hadas: Carillion and the danger of low prices,Northern Ireland’s political crisis risks both its economy and the UK’s unity. The British government will be forced to pass the region’s budget after talks to form a government failed. A return to direct rule from London may follow; an outcome that could see growth weaken and heighten sectarian tensions.
"UK pension watchdog needs new tools, and backbone","The investor sued Kleiner Perkins for discrimination, becoming a canary in the coal mine for a raft of sexual-harassment and gender-bias allegations rocking Silicon Valley, Hollywood and beyond. She discusses if this is a turning point for what she describes as a systemic problem."
Perfect storm blows ill winds across Chinese tech,"The key number to emerge from Saudi Arabia's big financial confab last week wasn't a sum of money, or an economic target, but a year - 1979. To thousands of foreign dignitaries, journalists and his own subjects, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to return the kingdom his family has ruled since 1932 to the more moderate society that prevailed before the siege of the Grand Mosque 38 years ago. He may need the global financial community’s help to make it happ"
Canada’s insurance policy on NAFTA isn’t loony,"Facebook’s long-term problem just got shorter. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to combat fake content in response to the fallout from Russia-backed ads. As government scrutiny grows, he warned profitability will take a hit at the $500 billion firm."
Davos gathering gets #MeToo balance mostly right,"Oh the irony. Chicago University is getting a $125 million gift from hedge-fund founder Ken Griffin. The “Chicago School” of economics, as it’s called, leans heavily towards free and efficient markets. Citadel boss Griffin’s name and cash – earned in a business that depends on markets being inefficient – will now endow the university’s economics department."
Murdoch’s Sky bid will ride out regulatory storm,"The bustling metropolis of Dubai should not, by rights, exist. The most populous of the seven absolute monarchies that constitute the United Arab Emirates has only modest oil reserves. To generate electricity it relies on importing natural gas - especially from Qatar, with which it severed diplomatic ties in June. And it has virtually no natural fresh water. Yet Dubai and its population of 2.7 million people now boast GDP of around $40,000 a head, according to "
"John Dingell, longest-serving member of U.S. Congress, dead at 92","Resurgence is proving more difficult than recovery for Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters. The former JPMorgan executive has shored up the Asia-focused lender’s balance sheet, shed risky loans, slashed costs and returned it to profitability. Restarting meaningful dividend payments is proving a tougher task."
Republican senators praise spending deal as path to Trump border request,"Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing’s new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump’s upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions"
"U.S. lawmakers tout U.S.-Japan-South Korea alliance as Seoul, Tokyo feud","Aetna's third-quarter results lay out its insurance value for CVS Health. Revenue at the $56 billion health-coverage firm fell 5 percent in the three months to the end of September, partly from dumping some Obamacare policies. But profit jumped 48 percent as the company kept costs under control. That offers alluring protection for CVS, whose pharmacy and drug-benefit business is threatened by rising competition and transparency."
Trump’s solar tariffs add new wrong to old,"U.S. congressional Democrats said on Tuesday they are not satisfied with the Trump administration's decision to ease sanctions on companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, demanding briefings and planning legislation."
Netflix cash-flow hole is becoming a moat,"When Martin Luther started the Protestant Reformation, just about the last thing on his mind was the promotion of commerce and manufacturing. The German monk’s 95 theses, posted on the door of Wittenberg's All Saints' Church on Oct. 31, 1517, were directly aimed at the unsavoury Roman Catholic business of selling indulgences which promised to smooth the entry into heaven. Luther detested these cash-for-grace deals, much as he despised Jewish usurers. He thought t"
The Exchange: Trian's Nelson Peltz,Burberry can take off the kid gloves as it waves goodbye to Christopher Bailey. The design chief will leave the British fashion brand next year. It has taken the company three years to unpick the deferential decision to hand him the chief executive role. His exit gives new boss Marco Gobbetti a freer hand to implement the group’s much-needed turnaround plans.
Cox: Klaus Schwab remakes Davos as The Apprentice,"Twin tailwinds are helping Ryanair to weather its pilot crisis. The 20 billion euro no-frills airline will meet its full-year profit goal, despite a rostering mess that led to the cancellation of thousands of flights. Passenger numbers were up 11 percent to 72.1 million in the six months to Sept. 30, according to Tuesday’s half-year report from the company. Ryanair’s fare cuts helped, but it also got lucky with rivals’ bankruptcies."
Xi Jinping offers a lesson on the “Davos discount”,"Ever since Colorado, Washington and other states legalized marijuana, the conventional wisdom has been that the U.S. weed business would in a matter of years move from a cottage industry into the arms of Big Tobacco. But Constellation Brands, maker of Svedka vodka and Corona beer, just dropped something into that punchbowl. It's taking the legit ganja party up a notch."
Viewsroom: Donald Trump goes to Davos,"Akzo Nobel has added another ball to an already tricky juggling act. Fresh from deflecting a takeover from one U.S. rival, the Dutch group confirmed on Monday that it is considering merging its paint unit with another, former DuPont subsidiary Axalta. A combination makes sense. But new Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker is busy grappling with weak results and a chemicals spinoff."
Tax cuts are looking like rare Trump win,British employers are proving slow to comply with rules that require them to disclose differences between how much they pay men and women. They may be even slower to close that gap if the laudable push for transparency is not backed up by the threat of eventual sanctions.
Review: The high cost of measuring the economy,"It turns out that the U.S. economy is doing just fine without tax cuts. Initial estimates show GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, despite the effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. An increase in goods made but not sold helped, but so did global growth and healthy corporate earnings. Protectionist policies could put the trend at risk."
Nestlé fashions a more activist-friendly board,"Prospective buyers of HSBC shares might question the upside for a bank that already trades at a chunky 1.3 times its tangible book value, a premium to European peers. Third-quarter results provided a rough guide for potential bulls. The message to incoming Chief Executive John Flint is clear: more of the same, please."
China’s battery champion will charge overseas,"Ping An Insurance has a long way to go to be considered a tech company. The $170 billion Chinese conglomerate delivered a 45 percent increase in third-quarter profit, powered in part by online users and artificial-intelligence initiatives. It also has added 300,000 agents this year, suggesting some old-fashioned growth in selling policies. That makes it hard to value it the same silly way as newly listed rival Zhong An."
"U.S. House panel postpones sanctions hearing, cites scheduling changes","Short-term activism can sometimes produce long-term good. That is the case with the $14 billion scrapped merger between Clariant and Huntsman, which would have combined two chemical makers with little overlap into what was effectively a conglomerate. Now that the merger is off, Clariant can consider other options. But there is a catch, in the form of the activist duo that killed the deal. Investors now need to know whether they are a catalyst, or an inhibitor."
"O'Rourke, Trump duel over wall, immigration in possible 2020 preview",A longtime ally of U.S. President Donald Trump was arrested on Friday for lying to Congress about the 2016 campaign's efforts to use stolen emails to undercut his Democratic rival in the latest arrest of the Special Counsel probe into possible election manipulation.
Trump not made decision about border security deal: official,"China's Baidu has stumbled in getting back to basics. Investors wiped more than 10 percent, or slightly more than $9 billion, from the web giant's market value in late U.S. trading on Thursday after it forecast disappointing sales for the rest of 2017. Baidu has cut costs and narrowed its focus to revitalise its search business. Unfortunately, that has yet to translate into less volatile results."
Amazon HQ2 choices disappointingly undisruptive,"A bid for Aetna is a defensive prescription for CVS Health. The drugstore and pharmacy-benefit company should be able to generate some cost savings if its $66 billion offer for the health insurer prevails. Even more important, it could help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution, and the unpleasant side effects of transparency and low margins that may follow."
Carillion mess puts Corbyn a step closer to power,Comcast is earning its peacock feathers. The $170 billion U.S. media firm was early and careful expanding beyond cable. Two examples are its purchase of NBC Universal - originally with its peacock logo - and a recently launched wireless phone service. Comcast stock has trounced the shares of Verizon Communications and AT&T. The company led by Brian Roberts has even pulled away from Walt Disney's market value this year.
China's rebound misses serious foreign money,President Xi Jinping emerged stronger at the end of China’s Communist Party Congress. His desire to consolidate control however may not help his plans to keep the Middle Kingdom’s economic engine humming. Plus: U.S. telecom firms try again to dial up a merger.
Tim Cook goes as American as Apple’s pie,"The congressman and chair of the Freedom Caucus thinks neither Republicans nor Democrats have had success in being the governing party. The Exchange went to his office to discuss what that means for tax reform and other issues, and why members of Congress could lose their jobs."
"Hadas: Malthus, Condorcet and “shithole” economics","Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince, wants to build utopia from scratch. This week he unveiled his vision for NEOM, a shining city on the Red Sea where entrepreneurs will draft the rules and robots outnumber people. One day, the imagined metropolis may even become a publicly traded company."
UK poorly placed to fight Carillion domino effect,"Beijing’s dollar bonds show how Chinese risk has been repriced. The country is selling $2 billion of five-and 10-year sovereign dollar bonds, the first such issue since 2004. Despite recent downgrades by global rating agencies, these are likely to yield just 30 to 50 basis points above U.S. Treasury bonds. Local banks can guarantee demand if needed, but there is also a genuine reassessment of China risk underway."
Uber's next ride-share could be in Southeast Asia,"Banks just scored a victory against disgruntled customers – and in the longer term, against themselves. The U.S. Senate has killed a rule allowing groups of consumers to sue financial firms and card issuers, even when the small print of their contracts prohibits them from doing so. Clauses that keep customers out of the courts have caused reputational problems for Wall Street before, and will again."
Sugar-for-supplements swap will test Nestlé boss,"As China's Communist Party tightens its grip, Western hopes that rising incomes would produce more economic and political opening look like wishful thinking. For foreigners this ""new era"" means more risk emanating from the People's Republic."
GE’s legacy losses reinforce case for breakup,Lloyds Banking Group’s dividend gusher has suffered a regulatory blockage. Britain’s biggest retail lender reported a robust pre-tax profit of close to 2 billion pounds for the three months to September and topped up its already-healthy capital ratios. Shareholders might have hoped that Lloyds will spray some of that cash in their direction. Regulators have other ideas.
Alibaba rival’s switch in logistics stacks up,"The U.S. Senate advanced legislation reaffirming support for allies in the Middle East on Monday, including fresh sanctions on Syria and a measure that combats the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians."
Trump objects to measure ending U.S. support for Saudis in Yemen war,"It’s official: President Xi Jinping now ranks as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, and perhaps even Mao Zedong. The president emerges from the party congress, a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle, with his name in the party constitution and no successors in sight. There’s little doubt he can now bend the bureaucracy to his will, but that’s not necessarily a boon for market reform."
U.S. presidential candidate Harris says she tried pot - and inhaled,"It’s official: President Xi Jinping now ranks as the most powerful Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, and perhaps even Mao Zedong. The president emerges from the party congress, a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle, with his name in the party constitution and no successors in sight. There’s little doubt he can now bend the bureaucracy to his will, but that’s not necessarily a boon for market reform."
California pulls most National Guard troops from U.S.-Mexico border,"Republicans appear giddy about the prospects of a historic tax overhaul, but like most highs, this one seems unlikely to last. The GOP expects to pass a budget resolution this week that paves the way for a reform bill, which the U.S. House of Representatives aims to approve by Thanksgiving. But they still haven’t solved their deficit dilemma, and President Donald Trump is shooting down potential revenue raisers."
Carillion pension hole is ominous for UK companies,"UniCredit is getting an early start on its recovery path. A data glitch forced Italy’s biggest bank by assets to publish third-quarter results two weeks ahead of schedule. Fortunately, the figures show lower costs and stronger capital. And a fee-boosting partnership with French asset manager Amundi helped offset the drag from low interest rates."
Shareholders leave Autos 2.0 on the hard shoulder,"It's a big week for Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a Davos-like gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into Riyadh to see at first hand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the up-in-the-air status of the bigge"
Carillion collapse is UK outsourcing stress test,"General Electric’s quarterly earnings, so bad that even new Chief Executive John Flannery called them “horrible,” have put fresh pressure on a stock that’s down more than 25 pct this year. The performance threatens to add insult to injury. The last surviving original member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average risks being excluded from the benchmark."
Telecoms IPO would be a smart step for SoftBank,"Italy's wealthy north can teach Catalonia a lesson in demanding self-rule. Voters in Lombardy and Veneto, which together make up around 30 percent of Italian gross domestic product, asked for more autonomy in referendums at the weekend. Like Catalonia, these territories want to keep more tax revenue. But unlike the fractious Spanish region, they stopped short of demanding independence. Such gentle pressure may yield better results."
Facebook discovers cost of factory-farming users,"For Abenomics fans, the results of Japan’s snap election Sunday were sweet. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition has retained a two-thirds ""super majority,"" paving the way for him to become the nation’s longest-serving leader."
Review: “The Post” gets more relevant by the hour,"If Daimler’s cars were as slow as its restructuring, the company would have few customers. The Mercedes-Benz parent has problems aplenty, which bumper third-quarter sales do little to change. A plan to carve out its car and truck units might help lift its valuation if that eventually led to a separate listing. But at the current pace of progress, investors have no reason to give the company much credit."
Markets start doing Mario Draghi’s job for him,"China’s taciturn central bank governor suddenly has lots to say. Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People’s Bank of China, grabbed headlines by warning on Thursday of a possible “Minsky moment.” His reference to a potential financial and economic crash follows other urgent calls for reform in recent days. The comments seem aimed at burnishing his legacy, as well as trying to ensure a like-minded successor fills his shoes."
Uniqlo owner has too much cash insulation,"U.S. Department of Agriculture has paid out $5.94 billion as of Jan. 28 to farmers, a representative said on Monday, in aid designed to offset the negative impact of tariff imposition."
Walmart pay hike is less than largesse,"PayPal's future rests on striking a quadruple whammy. The $80 billion payments firm, which announced estimates-beating third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is worth as much as American Express – more, if an after-hours bump in its stock holds up. At 31 times the next 12 months’ estimated earnings, it trades at a higher multiple than Visa or MasterCard. Justifying such a rapid rise requires Chief Executive Dan Schulman to execute well on four crucial strategies."
Viewsroom: China’s dubious shot across U.S. bow,"Verizon’s perch as the No. 1 carrier in the United States looks secure. The $200 billion telecom firm reported a rise in wireless subscribers on Thursday. But the gap is narrowing. Cable rivals Comcast and Charter are also offering mobile services, AT&T is trying to become a media company and Sprint and T-Mobile may yet merge. A heavy debt load hobbles Verizon’s ability to quickly change lanes."
Virginia official accused of rape will have to resign if allegations are true: governor,"The NYU marketing guru swung by Times Square to discuss what's next for ""The Four"" tech behemoths - Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook. Among his predictions: one of them will be hit with a $10 bln-plus antitrust fine and Amazon will choose New York for its second headquarters."
Factbox: Democratic presidential contenders jump into 2020 fray,"Call it teething trouble with tezzies. One of the biggest so-called initial coin offerings to date, which raised some $230 million for a blockchain project called Tezos, has led to a spat between its architects and a Swiss foundation that controls the digital cash, according to a Reuters special report (http://reut.rs/2gncW1B). Even in the world of crypto-currencies, traditional financial motivations apply."
Democrat Schiff questions if Mueller probing Trump-Deutsche Bank link,"Free markets sound like such a good idea. They offer choice and opportunities, which are good things. And who does not want freedom? Besides, if the alternative to these markets is the impassive, incompetent bureaucratic state, then the policy path is obvious. Let markets go free and peg back governments, so their only role in the productive economy is to deal with the occasional failure of markets to work as they should."
M&S held back by dowdy online look ,"Unilever’s struggle gives hope to predators. The consumer giant that fended off a bid from Kraft Heinz earlier this year reported weak third-quarter sales on Thursday. Chief Executive Paul Polman is sprucing up brands, but the more pedestrian Unilever’s performance, the more vulnerable it becomes."
China is stuck in a petroleum Catch-22,"China’s leaders seem to have made peace with the old economic model. More lending, roaring exports and higher property prices helped push up output by 6.8 percent in the third quarter. For all the talk of innovation, restructuring and deleveraging, the fundamentals driving the world's second-largest economy have not changed. China still depends on investment more than consumption, manufacturing over services, and cheaper products rather than stronger brands. Fo"
"Wells Fargo, Under Armour may attract activists","Global bank watchdogs are acting as a line of defense against a U.S. deregulatory push. The U.S. Treasury Department will soon decide whether to recommend scrapping the post-crisis bank resolution regime, as some Republicans urge. But foreign regulators are threatening to impose new curbs on American firms if it's ditched."
Jack Ma opens floodgate on Hong Kong tech listings,"Rio Tinto bought a coal mine in Mozambique in 2011 for too much money. U.S. and UK regulators now say it came clean about the real, diminished value of the mine too late. The second type of problem is less likely to recur. Rio has settled one case already and, in any event, the accounting rules for writing down badly priced acquisitions are relatively clear. If only there were similar safeguards against mining bosses getting carried away with deals in the first p"
Sainsbury’s is proxy for UK retail’s split fate,"Few central banks have been busier over the last 22 months than Indonesia’s. Despite eight easing moves, however, growth is stuck at 5 percent, lagging China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam. Consumer spending was down an average 1.1 percent in July and August year-on-year."
ICO represents last-gasp hope for struggling Kodak,President Donald Trump’s deal to end the U.S. government shutdown without getting money for his border wall drew immediate scorn from some of the prominent conservative figures whose support may be crucial to his 2020 re-election bid.
Chancellor: Bitcoin will never be real money,"The Chinese Communist Party’s 19th National Congress kicks off this week. Delegates at the week-long confab will select new leaders, including for key financial and economic posts. But the spotlight will be on Xi and whether he can consolidate his power and extend his reign. Listen to the podcast: https://soundcloud.com/reuters/president-xi-jinpings-moment"
German workers may frustrate ECB’s inflation hopes,"Goldman Sachs pipped Morgan Stanley on style in the third quarter, but not on substance. Lloyd Blankfein’s firm cranked out $2 billion of earnings in the three months to the end of September, at an annualized return on equity of 10.9 percent. That bested the 9.6 percent showing of Goldman’s main Wall Street rival – the first time this year that it has come out ahead. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman, though, has crafted a more attractive-looking business"
Samsung ends a stellar year on worrisome note,Doing the right thing is its own – and sometimes only – reward. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s hints that policy interest rates may soon rise can be justified by higher inflation. But he is in a no-win situation. The central banker will be criticised for hurting a slow-growing economy if he hikes and accused of playing fast and loose if he delays.
Tech backlash catches up to Apple,"Calls to action are designed to provoke an immediate response. Such imperatives are understandable in the case of Credit Suisse. Shares in the Swiss lender are 13 percent below the price at which it raised money from investors in 2015 and have underperformed the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index by 23 percent since Tidjane Thiam became chief executive. Even so, a plan to split the Zurich-based group into three faces a capital markets conundrum."
"Exclusive: U.S. in direct contact with Venezuelan military, urging  defections - source","Nothing will concentrate the minds of North Korean leaders more than a Chinese oil embargo. Nearly 90 percent of the country's petroleum comes across the border, giving Beijing enormous  leverage. Cutting off these shipments would swiftly weaken the North's military capacity and help restart negotiations."
U.S. lawmakers introduce bipartisan bill on cockpit safety,"There are two things the next leader of the Federal Reserve must prepare for: a recession and a public beating. The first is a statistical likelihood. The second, however, is a bankable certainty. If there is anything predictable about President Donald Trump, it is his willingness to bully institutions with authority separate from his own. And the U.S. central bank's effectiveness relies on its independence."
"U.S. must prevent air accidents involving drones, lawmaker warns","Netflix's valuation outstrips its burgeoning opportunity. The $87 billion video-streaming service hit another all-time high on Monday, benefiting in part from Comcast and AT&T recently warning of a fall in subscribers. Pay-TV customers cutting the cord should mean more viewers for Netflix. But even that and a fee hike last month don’t justify it trading at a sky-high multiple."
British shoppers are a shaky economic backstop,"Retailers hoping to put themselves up for sale are in for a long winter. Take Nordstrom. With large insider stakes and growing revenue, the $6.7 billion department-store chain was a prime candidate for a buyout. Now it is shelving its sale until after the holidays. It may be hoping for a higher price. But the delay suggests even risk-tolerant buyers are cool on the sector."
Trump would be wise to ease up on Seoul,"Europe is poorly placed to deal with Austria’s rightward drift. The far-right Freedom Party scored well in the country’s election and may enter government. Though it has been in power before, the challenges facing Europe are potentially more serious now."
Bannon woes gift Rupert Murdoch a Happy New Year,"Microfinance in India is starting a new conventional life. IndusInd, a large private sector bank, has agreed to buy Bharat Financial Inclusion – the country’s poster child of niche lending – in an all-share deal for $2.4 billion. That works out as a premium of 11.4 percent over the last trading price, or more if calculating from earlier in the year, when deal rumours started circulating. Either way, the terms look fair given concerns over the sustainability of in"
Anti-euro debate rears its head in Italy,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate could pass a temporary spending bill to reopen the federal government later on Friday, as long as there was ""cooperation."""
Beijing will allow a local government default,"China's President Xi Jinping wants to regain the private sector's confidence even as he squeezes it more tightly. Aligning private investment with state priorities could grease the bureaucratic skids for some companies, but more official meddling in board rooms is unlikely to produce good business decisions. Opaque party politics will confuse outside investors and blur the line between some state and private companies."
Viewsroom: Debt markets set for wild ride,"Warning signs are flashing after another big quarter at Samsung Electronics. The South Korean group's top executive, Kwon Oh-hyun, unexpectedly resigned on Friday following record-smashing forecasts for operating profit. An early lead in memory chips has fuelled blistering earnings growth at Samsung despite legal woes. But as rivals circle, a widening leadership vacuum looks worrying."
Debt markets will call time on equity rally,Sky shareholders face a choice between principles and profit. Some investors are planning to oppose Chairman James Murdoch’s re-election because he is also chief executive of 39 percent owner Twenty-First Century Fox. But kicking up a stink might further jeopardise Fox’s offer for the European pay-TV group.
Intel flaws hint at tech “too big to fail” risk,Nelson Peltz narrowly lost his acrimonious bid for a P&G board seat. Honeywell’s decision to spin off two small units was less than Dan Loeb lobbied for. These are temporary setbacks. Past experience and their financial firepower make shareholder activists a powerful force.
Oil bulls look to Trump rather than Iran protests,"Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg. Mark Zuckerberg’s right-hand woman on Thursday deftly fielded questions about Russia-backed ads and the social network’s broader role in society. It was a notable contrast to the bumbling way her boss handles the limelight, especially since the $500 billion company has come under greater scrutiny."
Hong Kong will start atoning for missing Alibaba,"Owners of Wall Street banks are being taken for a Washington ride. The S&P 500 Bank Index has surged 12 percent since Sept. 8. That is not justified by the trajectory of earnings, as JPMorgan and Citigroup showed on Thursday with results that were no better than steady. Tax cuts would support higher stocks, but they're at best some way off. In the meantime, banks have other concerns."
Pompeo visit to focus on U.S. concerns over Huawei in central Europe,Hartford is one of America's poorest cities in one of its richest states. And it's about to get worse for Connecticut's capital as Mayor Luke Bronin wrestles with a fiscal crisis that's likely to end in a bankruptcy filing. Rob Cox dropped in to hear his vision for reviving Hartford.
Chief Justice Roberts emerges as key figure on U.S. Supreme Court,"British Prime Theresa May’s energy plan has few political merits and even fewer economic ones. Her government said on Thursday it will cap the most commonly used energy prices until 2020 to ensure consumers pay less. The intention is laudable, but the biggest intervention since Britain privatised its energy industry three decades ago may do more harm than good."
Negotiators on U.S. border security funds eye deal by Monday: lawmakers,"President Xi Jinping’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech. China's government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors."
Tech salad will come with a side of SLAW in 2018,"Goldman Sachs is trying to extricate itself from a box by thinking outside it. The Wall Street firm has set up a small team in what’s known internally as the Innovation Lab, to cook up supposedly clever ideas for big clients. The resulting acquisitions may end up destroying value for the shareholders of the companies involved, but Goldman’s own investors should be pleased the investment bank is trying new things."
Hadas: Albanian mania is cautionary crypto tale,"The House Intelligence Committee will release all transcripts of interviews in its probe of Russian election interference to the special counsel's office, its Democratic chairman said on Friday after Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, was charged with lying to Congress."
Next cheer may delay essential style overhaul,"What do you get when you merge psychology with economics? Richard Thaler, who just won the Nobel Memorial Prize in the latter field, has an answer, which he calls behavioural economics. The University of Chicago professor’s approach to the study of the mind is more dismal than cheerful. He made his reputation pointing out some of the ways that people do not think straight."
"EU’s market big bang offers clear pain, fuzzy gain",British taxpayers could end up funding Santander’s efforts to grab a larger share of the UK business banking market. Helping one of Europe’s biggest lenders sounds like an odd way to shake up the dominance of established banks. But small-business customers will probably benefit over time.
Ant's U.S. march may require China-like steps,"Chinese officials probably don’t read literary critic Harold Bloom. If they do, they are ignoring his advice to “make what is implicit ... finely explicit.” A dispute over whether the government will stand behind the potential liabilities of Syngenta , a Swiss seed maker acquired by a Chinese state firm earlier this year for about $43 billion, shows the problems that result from habitual murkiness."
Ant's MoneyGram fail becomes America First symbol,"Painkillers and pile cream: these are either the recipe for a terrible night in, or a potentially good corporate deal. Pfizer, the $215 billion U.S. drugmaker, has tasked investment banks with looking into a spinoff or sale of its consumer-goods division, which makes Advil and Preparation H. New GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley would be well placed to offer a home."
TV content wars will have grisly season finale,"Meal-kit delivery service HelloFresh could prove to be the corporate equivalent of a soufflé: enticing at first glance, but prone to sagging. Given an unproven business model and the flame-out of U.S. rival Blue Apron after its own initial public offering, the loss-making German group’s plan to float belongs in the deep-freeze. "
Italy will go back to its old ways in 2018,"China’s politicians are preparing for a pivotal event. The leadership reshuffle at the Chinese Communist Party Congress, a meeting held once every five years set to kick off on October 18, will see most of the country’s top officials step down. All eyes will be on President Xi Jinping, who could upend decades of party tradition by seizing more power. Some hope a stronger Xi will put China back on the liberalization path. The fear is he will dismantle the cons"
"Breakingviews predicts a frothy, frustrated year","There’s no such thing as a founder who goes quietly. Weinstein Co, the film studio that ousted one of its two eponymous brothers amid sexual-harassment allegations, now joins other companies like Fox News and Uber that parted company with influential bosses who misbehaved, or stood idly by while others did. There’s dual risk, both from what the departing founder takes away and what they leave behind."
Icahn wins SandRidge battle but war isn’t over,"Edmund Burke, a father of modern conservatism, emphasised the principle of gradual change over revolutionary fervour. HSBC will have demonstrated the same values if John Flint, head of retail banking and wealth management, replaces Stuart Gulliver when he steps down as chief executive next year. The consummate company man, who has spent nearly three decades at the sprawling Asia-focused lender, is awaiting approval from regulators, according to the Sunday Times. "
No talks between Trump and China's Xi before trade deadline,China's moves to slash reliance on the internal combustion engine signal tough times for the country's oil majors. A push into new energy vehicles (NEVs) – including battery-powered and hybrid cars – could curb demand for black gold. Sinopec and PetroChina will be hardest hit. The policy will also add to downward pressure on global crude prices.
Senate committee to consider resolution against Nord Stream 2 pipeline,"Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America's electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors. There's no particularly good reason for shareholders to deny the pushy investor, whose hedge fund Trian Partners owns 1.5 percent of the $235 billion diapers-to-shampoo conglomerate, a seat at the table. Yet as at the ballot box, a combination of voter apathy and arcane rules is likely to leave three investors holdi"
Trump stokes Democrats' Virginia turmoil as scandal snares Republican,"U.S. senators made a new try at ending a partial month-long government shutdown through a temporary funding bill on Thursday, but President Donald Trump demanded a ""down payment"" for a border wall that Democrats reject."
America better at finding natural gas than using it,"Procter & Gamble is counting on a variation of America's electoral arithmetic as its best hope for keeping Nelson Peltz off the board of directors.

"Goldman loses on tax swings, gains on roundabouts","Japan is finally warming up to buyouts. The world’s third-biggest economy should be a prime hunting ground for private equity: Japanese firms make great products and are often parochial, poorly run, and undervalued, offering lots of room for improvement. Yet the country has long frustrated foreign PE shops. This year offers proof things are improving."
Viewsroom: Investors target sexual misconduct,"On paper, Catalonia looks viable as an independent state. The region which accounts for around a fifth of Spain’s economy has gross domestic product roughly comparable to Finland’s. Its residents are on average richer and more likely to have a job than other Spaniards. Nevertheless, the economic odds are stacked against the secessionists."
European soccer’s spending splurge will intensify,"Yahoo is like a zombie feasting on Verizon’s brains. Marni Walden, a top executive at the $200 billion U.S. telecom group, is leaving just a day after the internet firm she helped to acquire tripled its tally of customer accounts exposed to a 2013 hack. While the company suggests the timing is a coincidence, it’s clear that Yahoo is a problem that continues to fester."
Man City can narrow the deficit in Chinese soccer,Ford boss Jim Hackett’s plan to catch up with rival GM on electric and self-driving vehicles starts with $14 bln of cost cuts. China may be in pole position as it considers banning gasoline cars entirely. But plenty of factors could delay mass adoption of new technology.
Apple and Saudi test out their comfort zones,"Everything old is new again in finance. Navient, which services debt, is buying startup student-loan refinancer Earnest for less than half its 2015 valuation. Even then, it’ll eat into the new owner’s earnings and share buybacks. Worse, Navient faces a fresh lawsuit over dodgy practices."
Exchange podcast: Professor Anand Menon,"Killer whales sometimes hunt seals with carefully-orchestrated attacks to tip them off disintegrating ice floes. UK-listed theme park operator Merlin Entertainments may be planning something similar with SeaWorld, by trying to dislodge its Busch Gardens division. Breaking up the operator famed for its orcas might create some value, but it still looks a slippery target."
China will pull private capital into state orbit,"Here comes one more way to bet on green energy. En+ Group, a company owned by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska which supplies electricity to and controls aluminium outfit Rusal, aims to raise $1.5 billion in a London and Moscow listing. It touts its clean, mostly Siberian hydropower, but new public investors will have little say. The cornerstone backer, a Singapore-based partner of the Chinese group that just bought into Rosneft, may see greater advantage."
Xi’s tighter grip will tax Chinese real estate,"President Donald Trump’s visit to Puerto Rico risks compounding the damage caused by Hurricane Maria. His vow on Tuesday to wipe out the U.S. commonwealth’s huge debts sent its bond prices plunging on Wednesday. The island’s devastation may well necessitate a fresh restructuring, but that won’t address urgent issues. The White House needs to provide money and supplies, not distraction."
"Taxes done, Paul Ryan has pick of Midwest boards","Three years into a turnaround, Tesco’s management team has displayed more skill than luck. Chief Executive Dave Lewis has boosted margins at Britain’s biggest supermarket, shrunk the pension deficit and cut debt. The first dividend payment in three years confirms the recovery. Yet threats from inflation, weak consumer demand and online rivals have Tesco shares stuck in a rut."
Trump adviser Kushner to visit Middle East on peace plan's economic part,"President Donald Trump said on Thursday if Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer come to an agreement to end the partial government shutdown, he would support it."
Trump-Kim summit venue shows possibility of moving beyond conflict: State Department,"Arundhati Bhattacharya broke the mould for India’s banks. Bad debts rose and the share price underperformed during her four years running the country’s largest lender. But State Bank of India’s straight-talking, 61-year-old chairwoman ensured it was the best of an ailing bunch of public-sector lenders and was unafraid to face up to errant tycoons."
U.S. calls on Iran to halt space launches that defy U.N. resolution,"Nestlé can pre-empt activist Dan Loeb’s next move. The $265 billion Kit Kat maker’s directors are light on consumer and digital expertise. Half the 14 of them are from Switzerland, the company’s home market but one that’s worth just 2 percent of sales. Nestlé’s latest revamp plans are far from radical and the Third Point founder may next seek boardroom changes. Nestlé could head off a fight by beating him to it."
Catalonia poll delivers no Christmas joy,"In a Japanese ad-land spat, Bain Capital has the advantage. On Monday, the U.S. buyout firm unveiled a 152 billion yen ($1.3 billion) deal to privatise Asatsu-DK, Japan’s third-largest advertising agency.  This gives ADK’s bosses a way to escape a disappointing 1998 tie-up with Britain’s WPP."
Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt sails off before the storm,"Two rights at Uber are in danger of making a wrong. Travis Kalanick's newly appointed directors add useful expertise to a flawed board. And the effort by incumbents to limit the ousted founder's power as part of a deal to raise capital from SoftBank also makes sense. Both stand to lose, though, if they dig in too firmly against each other."
Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt sails off before the storm,"Casino stocks fell and gunmakers’ jumped after the worst shooting in U.S. history left an estimated 58 dead. Horrific as it is, the incident is unlikely to leave a lasting impact on gun laws, markets, political debate or voters’ minds."
"Tax cuts crystallize haves, wants, can’ts, won’ts","Sometime between fighting the global financial crisis and averting the breakup of the euro zone, central bankers began to be viewed as superheroes. They are in danger of becoming victims of their own success."
Activists are at the back door of fortress luxury,"The Catalonia crisis is a painful distraction for Spain. Sunday’s acrimonious independence referendum in the region is unlikely to trigger a break-up of the country. Nevertheless, investors may have to attach a bigger political discount to its recovering economy."
Asahi’s Tsingtao misadventure has one positive,"The Catalonia crisis is a painful distraction for Spain. Sunday’s acrimonious independence referendum in the region is unlikely to trigger a break-up of the country. Nevertheless, investors may have to attach a bigger political discount to its recovering economy."
Exchange podcast: Newark Mayor Ras Baraka,"Ryanair is living down to its cheapskate reputation. The budget airline is facing irate passengers and an angry regulator after cancelling more than 20,000 flights over the coming seven months. This combination could be an existential threat for most companies. For the Irish carrier, however, indifference to customers is an integral part of its discount offering."
Cox: Is Wall Street more democratic than America?,"One of the chief strengths of crypto-currencies is becoming their weakness. Freedom from regulation was the big draw of bitcoin, ether and their proliferating kind. But the exchanges set up to trade them often lack basic controls over identity, fraud, technology and even volume, a Reuters investigation shows. Without fixes, that will consign digital currencies to the financial fringe."
How to know if America’s big tax bet pays off,"U.S. President Donald Trump said in a late night Tweet on Wednesday that he would delay a State of the Union address until the government shutdown was over, responding to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's move to obstruct his plans for the speech."
Five possible triggers of the next market shock,"China's Sina is only likely to produce a qualified victory for activists. U.S. hedge fund manager Aristeia Capital wants the $8 billion web group to consider a sale or a merger with subsidiary Weibo. The former would never get past Chief Executive and Chairman Charles Chao, and the latter is a bad idea. But Chao could compromise by expanding the board, stepping up buybacks and handing out more Weibo shares."
Acting U.S. attorney general will not testify if House subpoena issued: Justice Department,"Even IKEA can't build everything. The Swedish furniture maker has bought TaskRabbit, the odd-jobs app. Though the price is undisclosed, it's a rare startup acquisition that makes sense."
Trump-Powell dinner on Monday 'constructive': White House official,"Most savvy American companies learned long ago that hangars full of private jets for personal use by executives paint an easy target for investor activists. So it's puzzling to see Donald Trump's cabinet members flying in the sort of high style formerly associated with tin-eared corporate chieftains. It makes the next personnel decision for the president, famous for his ""you're fired"" catchphrase, the easiest of his short, tumultuous administration."
"Senators Warren, Warner question contractors, military on unsafe housing","Hedge-fund star Mike Novogratz thinks he has crypto-currencies figured out. The one-time manager of Fortress Investment Group’s flagship macro fund is pinning his comeback hopes on digital coins. Their volatility is alluring when tranquil markets are depressing industry returns. But that can be a trap, as the investor well knows."
Best thing Trump and Xi can do in 2018 is nothing,The sexual revolution's greatest salesman has put down his smouldering pipe at 91. Hugh Hefner built Playboy magazine's blend of nudity and smarts into a business empire crowned with a bunny-ear logo that is recognised worldwide. But Hefner’s business aged far less gracefully than he did.
Bitcoin finds unlikely ally in Asian watchdogs,Alphabet has cleared the deck for a huge antitrust fight. The holding company of Google is separating its European shopping unit and allowing rivals to bid for ads. That frees up Google to battle the EU over claims it uses its Android operating system to dominate online search.
U.S. political doomsday will hurt economic growth,Chinese online insurer ZhongAn soared in its trading debut on Thursday. The runaway success of this deal undermines the Hong Kong stock exchange’s push for a third board with looser listing terms to lure more technology companies. That underscores how the city is already well-placed to win new listings - and suggests tweaks to the existing board will do just fine.
South Africa’s turnaround will come only slowly,"Add BHP Billiton and vacuum-cleaner maker Dyson to the list of converts to the electric-vehicle revolution. Arnoud Balhuizen, chief commercial officer at the world’s largest miner, told Reuters on Tuesday that battery-powered cars will reach a tipping point this year. On the same day, James Dyson revealed that his firm has had some 400 engineers building one for more than two years and expects to have a model in production by 2020. With Tesla, Volvo, General Mo"
A deluge of scandals in Japan will drive change,"Narendra Modi is walking a tightrope with his fight against “black money”. India's prime minister has unleashed a wave of bold, and sometimes brazen, initiatives to root out income that has been illegally obtained or not declared to the taxman. But that has chilled the economy. Managing the short-term fallout is key to smoothing the path to his re-election."
U.S. will miss out on infrastructure again in 2018,"College-sports fans just got a fresh reminder that corruption is alive and well in their field. Federal prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled criminal charges against 10 individuals, including four assistant coaches and an Adidas executive. The allegations may have merit, but the case shouldn’t obscure the real crime: a deeply flawed college-sports cartel."
Ryanair investors faintly see higher-cost future,U.S. Senate Democrats are questioning the legal basis of the Trump administration's move to continue work on its five-year offshore drilling plan during the partial federal government shutdown.
Thales’ 4.8 bln euro Gemalto bid puts jobs first,A botched probe into a hack at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a warning for other regulatory agencies. Chair Jay Clayton told senators on Tuesday that he doesn’t know the exact timing of a 2016 breach and his predecessor may not have been notified. It’s troubling given the sensitive market data kept there.
Trump’s China diagnosis falls short of a remedy,"Equifax can't even oust its hapless chairman and chief executive effectively. Rick Smith is ""retiring,"" as the corporate euphemism goes, after failing to prevent a massive cyber attack and fumbling the response - and with little financial penalty to boot. An interim management plan makes clear the board hadn't planned succession adequately either. Equifax needs regime change at every level."
China's shared bikes will merge into car lane,"Germany’s new electoral landscape promises upheaval for companies as well as politicians. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces tricky coalition negotiations after Sunday’s inconclusive elections. Organising a parliamentary majority requires simultaneous support from the pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens. The environmental party’s inclusion would be good news for Germany's emission-reduction ambitions, but may hurt carbon-guzzling utilities and automakers."
"Top Virginia Democrats imperiled by blackface, sex assault scandals","Japan Post is relying on fat payouts again. Tokyo is selling down about $11 billion of stock in the postal operator and financial holding company, with about three-quarters going to local households. Like the huge privatisation in 2015, this sequel owes little to the former state monopoly’s growth prospects – and almost everything to a cheap valuation and high dividend yield."
Senator Warren struggles to quiet criticism of her heritage claims,"Mark Zuckerberg's withdrawal of plans to excrete an inferior class of Facebook shares onto the investing hoi polloi should go down as an extraordinary moment in contemporary American capital markets. But the social network founder's climbdown is not an unalloyed victory for democratic capitalism. Facebook is facing other, existential, challenges that almost certainly rendered Zuckerberg's decision an expedient one. The battle to instill better corporate governa"
Democrat Schiff draws Trump ire with House intel probes,"Sunday's election will turn Germany into Jamaica. A coalition resembling the colours of the Caribbean country's flag – black for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, yellow for the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), plus the Greens – is the only viable option for a majority in the German parliament. Europe’s largest economy is facing a period of weak and unstable government."
Viewsroom: A Fox in the Mouse House,Euro zone reform was barely addressed in the run-up to the German election on Sunday. Yet Europe’s ambition to strengthen the foundations of the single currency may be the most high-profile victim of the vote in its biggest economy.  
Review: Why Brexit will ultimately please nobody,"Listed life can be rough. Sea, a Southeast Asian startup formerly known as Garena, has filed for a U.S. initial public offering of up to $1 billion.

Exchange Podcast: NY Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen,"The Federal Reserve is sailing into uncharted waters. The U.S. central bank will start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet next month. The timing is risky, with lawmakers set to spar again over government funding and the debt ceiling. The Fed’s portfolio downsizing will also cut the nearly $92 billion it sent to Treasury last year, adding to budget pressures."
Disney is Death Star for Europe’s telco media fad,"The U.S. Senate shifted slightly closer on Tuesday to resolving a month-long partial government shutdown, but there was no sign of relief anytime soon for 800,000 federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay."
"Disney deal widens Murdoch legacy, erases discount","Talk of cross-border banking M&A is back. UniCredit is interested in merging with Commerzbank, Reuters reported. BNP Paribas is also said to be a potential partner for the German lender. But international banking deals are complicated, political, and have modest economic benefits.  The Italian lender could make a case for tying-up with its 14 billion euro Teutonic peer, but closing a deal may be tricky."
South African gold giant throws Lonmin a lifeline,"Rupert Murdoch’s 1969 acquisition of the Sun marked the start of his assault on the cloistered world of British newspapers. “Ink”, James Graham’s play set in the year after the tycoon invaded Fleet Street, deftly traces the origins of the hyper-aggressive press culture that would eventually lead to a phone-hacking scandal and the demise of the News of World tabloid.

Tencent health push shows sneaking hubris symptoms,"Nestlé’s stake in L’Oréal looks ready for a makeover. The death of Liliane Bettencourt, whose family is the French cosmetics group’s largest shareholder, will revive the debate about the Nescafé owner’s 23 percent stake. Offloading it is the best solution. Putting 24 billion euros of value to better use could become Nestlé Chief Executive Ulf Mark Schneider’s big challenge."

Fox deal will test Disney’s chief Mouseketeer,"China's central bank has ordered lenders to halt business with North Korean clients, Reuters reports. Tightening Chinese sanctions on the secretive regime are starting to show signs of economic effect, but Kim Jong Un's volley of missiles tests continues. Half-hearted cooperation between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump is no credible deterrent, alas. The risk of real violence, instigated by a weak and reckless U.S. president, is rising."
Trump says expects announcement soon on recapturing Islamic State territory,Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democrats should win more votes than rivals. But they’ll need coalition partners to form a government. Choosing among them promises to be a nail-biter. Also: the Toys R Us bankruptcy won’t be a total loss for its private-equity owners.
U.S. border officials don't share Trump's zeal for border wall: lawmakers,"The Securities and Exchange Commission’s failure to respond properly to hacks into its systems puts U.S. cyber security on the back foot. Unlike the breach at credit-grading agency Equifax, the watchdog’s woes don’t put people’s data at risk. It’s the clumsy way it is dealing with the aftermath that’s the problem."
Trump: Democrat lawmaker Schiff has no grounds to probe his finances,"HTC is embracing an alternative reality. The ailing Taiwanese group is offloading part of its handset unit to Google for $1.1 billion. This will free up HTC to focus more on its risky but promising virtual reality business, where it is winning market share. Deeper ties with the U.S. giant might also help fend off rivals like Sony and Facebook."
M&A friction limits EU single-market opportunity,"ThyssenKrupp Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger is finally getting real on steel. More than two centuries after Friedrich Krupp started making cast steel in Germany’s Ruhr region, the industrial group is backing out of the industry. The historic joint venture with Indian rival Tata Steel unshackles it from a fickle, capital-intensive business which for years has been struggling to earn its cost of capital. It can pay ThyssenKrupp dividends on four levels."
Chancellor: Bitcoin speculators face total wipeout,"South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has a bright future with Cirque du Soleil, if he can keep balance on the world's thinnest diplomatic high wire. So far his attempts to juggle competing demands from Beijing and Washington aren't paying off. Both are using the North Korean crisis to score trade concessions. Moon should get off the high wire and pursue a third way: teaming up with Japan and other Asian powers."
ECB could use Steinhoff mess to improve QE,The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday it will reopen all Farm Service Agency offices on Thursday to offer services to farmers and ranchers during the partial government shutdown.
Ambani is programmed to punch through $100 bln,"Britain’s vote to leave the Europe Union took just one day – but the divorce process is dragging on. In October, talks between the two sides are supposed to shift from the terms of exit to the terms of re-engagement. There’s little chance of that happening. Despite the positioning papers published and legislation initiated, progress is being slowed up by bickering – within the UK government and between London and Brussels – as well as technicalities and economic "
Exxon climate U-turn deserves wary investor cheers,"China gave the auto industry an electric shock by announcing ambitions to phase out the combustion engine in the world’s largest car market. Details and deadlines are scant, but draft regulations accelerating the development of electric vehicles offer a glimpse of Beijing’s strategy: foreign automakers will pay the price. "
Bank of England is too sanguine on inflation,"In Lake Wobegon, the fictional setting for Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie Home Companion”, all the children are famously above average. Such illogic is embraced by active asset managers, all of whom peddle the idea that they can consistently beat the market mean. The growth of lower-cost passive funds has exposed the flaws in that thinking – and lent new urgency to the search for cost savings."
Cox: Popping gun bubble to bring financial casualties,"Germany’s election is not short on colour. Angela Merkel is all but certain to secure a fourth term as chancellor, and the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) will most probably win its first parliamentary seats. But otherwise the poll remains an open race. Breakingviews breaks down the possible combinations, and their consequences for Germany – and for Europe."
Westfield's $25 billion deal is mere retail therapy,China's drug companies could provide a boost to Big Pharma.

They are eyeing a slice of the $1 trillion-plus global medicine market.
Anti-LBO activist could benefit Toshiba investors,"Artificial intelligence is the backseat driver of SoftBank’s move on Uber. Masayoshi Son’s tech and telecoms group is close to investing $10 billion in the U.S. ride-hailing giant, the Wall Street Journal says. That reflects the Japanese maverick’s belief in the disruptive power of self-driving cars."
Trump’s anti-WTO rhetoric hurts America first,Bridgewater’s founder thinks his kindred spirit resides in China’s anti-corruption czar Wang Qishan. Both seek radical transparency – though Dalio’s hunt is tied to forging a business in the Middle Kingdom. Plus: Exxon’s salvation may lie in the oil fields of West Texas.
Former Trump lawyer Cohen congressional testimony postponed,"The National Rifle Association isn't known for the subtlety of its messaging. But in recent months, the leading shill for America's gun industry is sounding shriller than ever. That’s despite unprecedented support from Donald Trump, the first U.S. president to speak at its annual meeting in a generation. ""You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you,"" the commander-in-chief told the NRA's top brass and members in Atlanta in April. ""The eight-"
New Mexico governor pulls National Guard troops from U.S.-Mexico border,"MILAN - The European Commission is raising the investment bar for China. Brussels has come up with a pan-European scheme to vet sensitive purchases by other countries. Unlike the government committee that scrutinises acquisitions in the United States, its rulings will be non-binding. Even so, the People’s Republic will find it harder to buy European infrastructure and technology."
"Shutdown a Trump 'stunt,' says Democrat Abrams in reply to annual speech","Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering is an idea that deserves to be put back in the ground. The sale of a 5 percent stake in Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant may be pushed back into 2019, according to Bloomberg. Achieving the desired $2 trillion valuation always looked a stretch. If Riyadh really wants the money it has better options."

Crude-backed crypto-coin is mostly snake oil,"The campaign for a euro zone budget is a distraction. French President Emmanuel Macron is among those pushing for a fund, financed by taxpayers, to help counter economic shocks. But comments from European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday show the idea is a stretch. Other less dramatic – and less expensive – reforms might achieve the same result."
Exchange Podcast: Marcus Ruiz Evans,"Apple’s new handsets take features from Asia and add profit. While the latest iPhones boast big upgrades, much would be familiar to users of Samsung or Huawei phones. Apple's branding wizardry, price discipline and focus on richer customers set it apart when it comes to the bottom line."
Britain heads for Brexit in name only,"The so-called vampire squid of global finance will soon have a new tentacle: UK retail banking. Goldman Sachs plans to start taking British consumers’ deposits next summer, using the Marcus brand already launched in the United States. A lack of historical baggage, paired with the economies of scale that come from being a global financial giant, could be a distinct advantage. Given the limp returns currently on offer in investment banking, it’s certainly worth a s"
Seoul's contrarian tax hike makes for good start,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s past economic omissions may come back to haunt her if she wins a fourth term. Since taking office in 2005, she has failed to invest enough, tailor the welfare state to an ageing population, or prepare the country for costly climate change targets. The economy will pay the price during the next downturn."
Bitcoin looks like speeded-up unicorn hype,"China’s “insurtech” star is overemphasising the tech part of that combination. Zhong An was founded by the chairmen of internet heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent, Jack Ma and Pony Ma, and their counterpart at Ping An, the insurer, Ma Mingzhe. A mooted valuation of up to $12.9 billion for this financial technology-meets-insurance business owes more to the first two Mas than to the third."
Fossil-fuel slowdown spreads pain at GE and beyond,"Alexis Tsipras is desperate to avoid “suffocating supervision” of Greece’s actions when the country’s third bailout programme ends next August. At the weekend, he promised as much. But the best the Greek prime minister can hope for is that Athens will move from its current high-security prison to an open one – and that will happen only if he behaves."
Citi's $20 bln writedown would be just the ticket,"China is considering whether to stand its currency policy on its head. After years spent crushing yuan short positions, officials worry they've overheated the currency. But capping this rally will be tricky, diplomatically and economically.

Bipartisan group of lawmakers introduces bill to fight high drug prices,"The debates that swirl around the Bank of England today have echoed throughout its past. Familiar themes recur in “Till Time’s Last Sand”, David Kynaston’s magisterial history of the 323-year-old institution’s evolution from government lender to modern central bank. Contemporary arguments over independence, the right approach to monetary policy, bank bailouts and the City of London’s future turn out to be as timeworn as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street herself"
Viewsroom: Executive payouts in rude health,"Global insurers may get another bite at the Chinese cherry. After meeting with representatives from several foreign operators, Chen Wenhui, vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, pledged to further open the market. Executives have heard such promises before, but a recent shakeup of the industry and its regulator by Beijing could provide real opportunity."
France and Germany look too alike to bond markets,"Texas is facing $180 bln in hurricane cleanup costs, the most of any U.S. natural disaster. The Lone Star State has the wherewithal and chutzpah to cover a large chunk, yet expects Washington to pick up most of the tab. Global water risks, meanwhile, may require $12 trln to fix."
GVC plays regulatory roulette with Ladbrokes bid,"The likes of SEB, Handelsbanken and Nordea are stable, well capitalised and dull. Investors have spurned them in favour of eurozone banks. Yet the Swedes’ generous dividends are attractive – and if Nordea’s move to Finland leads to lighter regulation, they may get more so."
Walgreens gets in early on healthy growth in China,An American casino mogul is making a timely bet on Houston. The owner of both the Golden Nugget gaming enterprise and the Landry's restaurant empire will pay $2.2 billion for the Houston Rockets basketball team. Buying a trophy asset as the city rebuilds from Hurricane Harvey makes for awkward timing. And yet the deal also suggests an abiding faith in a recovery.
The Force could be with Disney-Fox deal,Facebook could do with some new friends in data. Its estimated audience doesn’t square with an official U.S. demographic tally. A growing list of counting problems could spell trouble as the $500 billion social network pushes into streaming and other higher-value material.
Trump and Warren make odd antitrust bedfellows,"Deutsche Bank Chief Executive John Cryan wants his robot-like colleagues to embrace their inner “revolutionary spirit” as they stand to be replaced by artificial intelligence. Critics might retort there is nothing innovative in getting fired. Deutsche’s shareholders, though, should welcome Cryan’s comments, while the bank’s staff may justifiably feel uncomfortable. They are among the most vulnerable as bloated German lenders seek to slash their payrolls."
Hadas: The mystery of lost competition,"Rupert Murdoch knows better than anyone that content is king. The media mogul, through his unit Star India, this week agreed to pay $2.6 billion for the global rights to the Indian Premier League (IPL). The huge outlay highlights the brash sport’s rapid rise and a race between traditional television and new digital players to secure content."

Brexit deal hinges on enlightened obfuscation,"Beijing wants more people to rent.

House panel readies subpoena to compel Whitaker testimony,"Maybe third time is a charm for Michael Ferro. The chairman of Tronc bought the New York Daily News from real-estate mogul Mort Zuckerman for $1 and the assumption of its liabilities. It’s a victory of sorts for the Chicago publisher, whose stock hovers near the price at which it fended off a takeover from Gannett. But it's another sad marker in the decline of print newspapering."
Senate environment panel okays Trump's pick to lead EPA,The future of the BRICS looks toxic. China and India stepped back from a border dispute just in time for a summit of the bloc of large emerging market countries. That helps Chinese President Xi Jinping keep up appearances ahead of a crucial political reshuffle. But the unusual tensions between the two Asian giants suggest the three-day gathering underway could be a last hurrah.
Jack Ma enlarges his Chinese payments peloton,"United Technologies isn't staying fully grounded in its quest for scale. The U.S. industrial conglomerate is paying $30 billion including debt for aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins. The strategy makes sense but, with a weak return on investment, United Technologies is paying up for the privilege of getting bigger."
Facebook targets children with Snap rip-off,"A prime rule of public relations is to not become the subject of the story. Bell Pottinger has broken that maxim in every way imaginable. The UK corporate communications firm is in meltdown following its work on a highly divisive campaign in South Africa. Though poor management is partly to blame, disruptions prompted by the rise of online media also played a role. It’s a red flag for an industry that has so far avoided the woes of traditional publishers."

"Cox: Trump bump aside, U.S. stocks lag in 2017","China’s political direction could soon get clearer. On Thursday, Beijing's official Xinhua news agency revealed an Oct. 18 start date for the biggest set-piece in the political calendar, the twice-a-decade Communist Party congress.

Senator warns of 'war' among Republicans over Trump border wall,"Wells Fargo's supersized scandal magnifies the spotlight on its chief executive. An outside review that examined a longer timeframe uncovered another 1.4 million potentially fake accounts at the U.S. mega-bank with a $2 trillion balance sheet.

Virginia governor meets with cabinet amid outcry over racist photo,"Bain Capital and Cinven are getting the Elliott shakedown. The private equity firms have bought a majority stake in German drugmaker Stada for 4.1 billion euros, but now the U.S. hedge fund wants a big premium in return for selling its minority shareholding. It’s a form of ransom – but the buyers can afford to pay it."
Daily Mail finally succumbs to media malaise,"China’s big banks are digging deeper into the housing market. First-half results from the country’s four largest lenders, released on Wednesday, showed year-over-year increases in earnings of between 1.8 and 11.5 percent. They are also extending new credit more slowly than the wider financial system. That relative restraint is welcome, as are some signs of improvement on bad loans.

Rio Tinto holds valuable card in Jakarta deal,United Technologies’ avionics bid looks airworthy. The conglomerate’s potential acquisition of Rockwell Collins should deliver enough cost savings to justify paying a reported price tag of nearly $23 billion.

"Hadas: Bitcoin at $10,000 is even more dangerous","The bailout of Otkritie, one of Russia’s biggest lenders, shows the perils of aggressive expansion and an incomplete system for winding up financial giants. It also rekindles anxiety over what it means for a bank to be too big to fail."
UK plays weak hand badly in Brexit poker,"Blackstone is raising its game in Japan. This week, the U.S. private equity giant hired Katsuyuki Kuki, a former top JPMorgan banker, as local chairman.

Slim chance of Kochs taking over Meredith media,"The impact of Hurricane Harvey intensifies an already brewing storm over U.S. federal flood insurance. The Texas disaster, which President Donald Trump is seeing firsthand on Tuesday, will put the government coverage program, already $25 billion in debt, further under water. Among other snags, the subsidized backstop insurance encourages building in high-risk areas."
Britain’s Brexit-ready banks a boon for government,"British banks argue that a deadline for consumers to claim for mis-sold loan insurance policies is a good thing. In narrow financial terms, that’s not quite true. The country’s financial watchdog has set an ultimatum of August 2019, backed by a TV ad campaign funded by the banks themselves. That is likely to provoke a rush of new claims which could make existing provisions look insufficient – and may not be the end of the saga anyway."
Uber backers face head-on collision with greed,"Toshiba aims to please almost everyone with a rejigged selloff. The stricken electronics group must sell its $17 billion memory unit quickly. The first attempt stalled thanks to troublemaking from Western Digital, upon which Toshiba is now pinning its hopes. Version 2.0 should still win antitrust approval - and looks Japanese enough to pass muster in Tokyo."
Virginia governor apologizes for racist photo but resists growing calls to quit,"Tropical Storm Harvey is exposing flaws in Donald Trump’s energy policies. The president wants to make America a dominant fuel exporter by promoting coal and opening up federal lands for oil drilling.

Julius Baer CEO bows out at private banking peak,"A guilty verdict for Samsung Group’s de facto leader is a victory for reformers. On Friday Jay Y. Lee, the third-generation boss of South Korea's biggest business, was sentenced to five years in jail for bribing the country’s previous president, embezzlement and other charges.

Bankers’ rule-change wish list starts in the weeds,"Infosys' founders are getting a second chance to leave behind a company that won't crash. Nandan Nilekani will return as non-executive chairman of the $32 billion Indian information technology firm he helped found.

Still, his appointment in place of two co-chairman streamlines the top ranks and is a fast way to calm investors after its first outside chief executive quit."

Offloading the company’s top brand to China’s Great Wall Motor, whose president has indicated interest, could raise billions. But it would leave an emaciated rump."
Nippon Paint's run at Axalta looks off-colour,Rupert Murdoch’s bid for Sky looks ever less rational. The media mogul’s Twenty-First Century Fox in December offered 11.7 billion pounds to buy the 61 percent it doesn’t own of the UK pay-TV group. Murdoch will struggle to make the deal pay – though that may not stop him.
Trump administration scrambles media signals,"BHP is using a commodity rally to fortify its financial position and placate critics. The Anglo-Australian miner swung to an annual net profit of $5.9 billion - missing forecasts but still improving on last year's $6.4 billion loss. Plans to exit a troubled shale business and hold off on investing in fertiliser mining chime with some demands from Elliott, the activist hedge fund. That compromise, plus a continued focus on financial strength, looks sensible."
WPP rebrands its weak Tokyo defence,"Neither Carl Icahn nor Donald Trump is looking good in a fight over biofuels regulations. The billionaire investor wanted rules changed to help CVR Energy, a refiner he controls. Icahn resigned on Friday as the president’s adviser on deregulation just ahead of a New Yorker story detailing these alleged conflicts of interest. The picture gets even murkier because the White House now seems to be saying there was no job for Icahn to quit."
Buffett-backed BYD could use a battery ram,"With the law riding shotgun, Uber is on an open road to obfuscation. Whether the ride-hailing service illegally fixed prices, for example, may now remain a secret after a court last week ordered the issue resolved in arbitration. It’s the same deal with whether drivers were stiffed on expenses; sexual-harassment claims against the company are also subject to confidential proceedings. Making the $68 billion firm fess up is mighty tough when the courts and others"
Randall Stephenson makes his last stand,"A high-stakes legal fight is brewing in the esoteric world of mobile-spectrum licensing. Telefonica’s O2 has much to lose, as do British consumers waiting for ultra-fast 5G internet."
Market will trump politics on Keystone pipeline,"Beijing has officially put its foot down on foreign takeovers of hotels, sports clubs and other sectors it deems ""irrational"". Some argue this was prompted by worries about bad debts resulting from silly deals. Perhaps, but the crackdown misses the root issue: domestic distortions that encourage companies to offset low profit margins at home with racier investments abroad."
Germany: World will be less secure without INF weapons treaty,"Economic nationalists still linger in the White House. The departure of Steve Bannon, the chief strategist who advocated protectionist, ""America first"" policies, represents a plus for the global economy. But other foes of open trade and immigration will continue to try to influence Donald Trump. The centrists’ economic fight waged by National Economic Council director Gary Cohn and others will get easier but it’s not over."
U.S.'s Bolton: Military intervention not imminent in Venezuela,Winning brings its own problems. Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to land a fourth term in German elections on Sept. 24 yet may be forced to govern with a small majority in partnership with the Free Democrats (FDP).  That would be bad news for Germany and the European Union.
NATO allies 'fully support' U.S. action on INF treaty,"With the partial U.S. government shutdown now in its 26th day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reschedule his State of the Union address - a move that could deny him the opportunity to use the pageantry of the speech to attack Democrats in their own chamber over the impasse."
Mugabe will cast a long shadow over Zimbabwe,"For Infosys, a new chief executive is not the answer. Vishal Sikka delivered outsize returns in three years at the helm of India's second largest outsourcer by market value. No wonder that the resignation of the company's first professional CEO amid an ugly spat with founder shareholders prompted a roughly 9 percent plunge in the share price."
Merkel’s weakness could give Europe strength,"Gary Cohn is facing the most difficult investment dilemma of his career. The former Goldman Sachs president helped steer the bank to safety during the financial crisis. Now he’s under pressure to abandon President Donald Trump, whom he serves as chief economic advisor. Remaining could hurt his reputation, but he’s been a moderating influence on trade and he’s also a point man on tax reform. Losing his Wall Street savvy would further damage the White House - a"
Alibaba deal guides grocers to checkout,"The UK government is trying to send a trade Trojan Horse to Ireland. The European Union wants Northern Ireland’s knotty border issue resolved before Britain’s wider exit terms from the bloc can be agreed. New proposals from London deftly advance the government’s trade agenda, couched in concern for the region’s peace process. It may not work, but it’s smart, because having Dublin onside raises the chances of Britain getting what it wants."
Review: The next fight for Latin America's soul,"The China Securities Regulatory Commission hasn't learned its lesson. This week the agency posted a self-congratulatory statement crediting its crackdown on financial risk for producing a stock market rally, smoothing out volatility and getting price-to-earnings ratios into line. As a result it said it has fully removed curbs on index futures trading in place since the brutal 2015 crash. Unfortunately, this suggests the CSRC has learned worrying little about m"
Viewsroom: AT&T’s $85 bln deal runs into static,"Amazon’s aggressive salesmanship now extends to its own debt. The e-commerce giant’s blowout $16 billion bond sale suggests almost unlimited potential for the retailing juggernaut to consider even more shopping. Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos’ outfit is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will too."
Northern Ireland is Brexit’s Gordian knot,"Washington has infrastructure all wrong. There's a big funding gap, but cash isn't the problem. There's more than enough capital in search of long-term investments. What the federal government needs to do is remove hurdles to private financing, be willing to take good ideas from elsewhere and help change the mindset of states, localities and consumers."
Cox: Amazon to become biggest impact investor ever,"Britain’s wage mystery is deepening. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest in more than four decades, yet wage growth is still tepid. There are some homegrown reasons why pay is not rising faster as joblessness falls, but at least one explanation is non-British in its origin."
Sorry is the hardest word for central bankers,"JD.com’s impressive quarter was flattered by some financial wizardry. The Chinese online retailer’s top line grew by some 44 percent, helping generate $144 million of earnings. Unless, that is, conventional American guidelines for calculating the numbers were applied, in which case it lost $42 million."
Da Vinci record vividly depicts scarcity value,"Take the money and run is the new Uber Benchmark. The ride-hailing firm, valued at nearly $70 billion in its most recent funding round, is beset by multiple controversies, managerial turmoil and huge losses. Early investor Benchmark may be loath to give in to demands to sell its 13 percent stake. But it would help restore some stability and let the venture-capital firm rake in billions."
Audit defect throws wrench in GKN re-engineering,"There is almost nothing that the Trump administration is doing right on tax, trade, immigration, infrastructure, energy or regulatory policy. At least that's the view of economist Jason Furman, who spent eight years working for the previous White House."
Trump re-election campaign began 2019 with $19 million in cash,"U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer was mistaken when he said the president's State of the Union address was off, his office said in a statement."
Trump says U.S. trade delegation to visit China in mid-February: Xinhua,"Economic boycotts are usually designed to force dramatic change. They deprive enemies of income that can be used to finance armies, feed propaganda machines and sustain populations - with the hope of provoking the target's people to overthrow their leaders. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain have followed much of this playbook since early June in their ostracism of Qatar, which they accuse of financing terrorism."
China says trade talks with U.S. made 'important progress': Xinhua,"Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne has a knack for buying and selling car brands at the right time. He snapped up Chrysler on the cheap in 2009, and spun off Ferrari six years later to create one of the world’s most richly-valued auto stocks. Alfa Romeo and Maserati would stretch even his dealmaking skills."
Exchange Podcast: Mike Novogratz,"Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne has said the car industry needs to come together, cut costs and stop incinerating capital. So far, his confessions have mostly fallen on deaf ears among competitors in Europe and North America. But it appears Marchionne has finally found a receptive audience - in China."
Cerberus puts German twist on distressed investing,"Ken Frazier is standing up to Donald Trump. On Monday, the Merck boss quit the White House manufacturing council to protest the president’s dismal response to Saturday’s white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. National duty, ego and fear of a Twitter rebuke may have kept corporate chieftains in their seats, but they have little to show for staying."
Hadas: Unintended consequences may be new normal,"Reports of the death of the London Interbank Offered Rate are premature. It’s true that Andrew Bailey, the head of Britain’s financial watchdog, gave banks, investors, and businesses notice on July 27 that they could not count on the discredited benchmark surviving indefinitely in its current form. But killing off Libor will be a long and messy business. Especially since those who issued its death sentence are keen to keep the rate alive for several years to avoi"
Upheaval could leave Zimbabwe further adrift,"The Japanese consumer is perking up. Figures released on Monday showed gross domestic product grew unexpectedly fast in the second quarter. The data is volatile and often revised. But the unbroken run of expansion, now 18 months long, is good news. Rising household consumption is even better news."
Trump's coal push loses power as U.S. goes green,"The Teamsters are throwing a wrench into the self-driving movement’s works. The union has convinced U.S. lawmakers to exempt commercial trucks from a bill allowing more autonomous vehicles on the roads. Granted, 3.5 million jobs are at stake. But as Tesla joins Daimler and others in the big-rig tech race, it’d be smarter to prepare haulers for a career shift."
"Private equity deserves U.S. tax hit, not startups","If data is the world’s most valuable resource, the people who produce it deserve a cut. A new UK law will hand citizens greater power over their online information. For companies, compliance standards – and fines for breaking the rules – will get steeper. Showing people the value of their digital data increases the possibility that they will seek compensation for it."
Euro zone boom stimulates reform complacency,"Counting anything in a country of India's size is a mammoth exercise. Nine months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped high-value banknotes in a clampdown on the “black economy”, there is no clarity on how much of the banned $240 billion individuals returned. Still, this has given real momentum to India’s anti-corruption campaign."
GE's shaman exorcises ghosts of false expectations,"Snap is haunting the market. The parent of the disappearing-message app reported its second consecutive quarter of disappointing results. Slowing user growth, more losses and fresh fallout from its lousy governance have erased a third of its market value. Others mulling going public may be scared off."
Vodafone is doing just fine without Liberty,"President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, William Barr, told lawmakers on Tuesday he would protect a federal probe into Russian election meddling from political pressure, stressing he would bring independence to the job and not shy away from breaking ranks with the administration."
Breakdown: Redesigned TPP deal goes to 11,"The U.S. president needs Beijing’s help with North Korea even more after his recent warmongering outburst. Yet his administration just slapped petty import tariffs on Chinese aluminum. Also: what a Google engineer’s sexist memo says about the firm, Silicon Valley and society."
Trump says wants big trade deal with China or will 'postpone' it,"SoftBank's Indian shopping spree is venture capital with a kick. The Japanese conglomerate's Vision Fund is splashing $2.5 billion on online retailer Flipkart, effectively rendering worthless an earlier near $1 billion punt on rival startup Snapdeal. The investment ranks as the largest private bet on an Indian tech company. But it also shines a light on SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's big-ticket investment flops."
"U.S., China made 'some progress' on structural issues in trade talks: U.S. Chamber","A takeover of Charter Communications would be a deal too far even for Patrick Drahi. The billionaire’s Altice and its U.S. arm are working on a bid for the $180 billion cable group, according to reports. The hefty price tag and Charter shareholder John Malone’s probable unwillingness to take stock with poor voting rights may scupper that."
U.S. envoy calls for full list of North Korean weapons programs,"Even the fear of possible Armageddon is no match for Wall Street's greed. U.S. investors already have shrugged off higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, mounting protectionist tendencies around the world and Washington dysfunction. President Donald Trump’s blunt warning to Pyongyang might have been a fresh reason to rush into gold or gunsmiths. Mr. Market, however, rarely foretells dire happenings."
Breakdown: Redesigned TPP deal goes to 11,"Netflix losing Disney sounds like an HBO sequel. The Magic Kingdom is yanking ""Cars"" and more from the $75 billion streaming service. Time Warner's pay-TV network also once grew so popular that Hollywood studios got scared and started rival options. HBO kept thriving and so will Netflix."
Breakdown: Redesigned TPP deal goes to 11,Worldpay has wrung ample concessions from Vantiv. The British payments group on Wednesday clinched a 7.9 billion pound ($10 billion) takeover by its U.S. rival after twice extending a bid deadline. It should be enough to appease unhappy UK investors.
UK economy will share Theresa May’s pain,McDonald's is going large in China. It will have to ensure that breakneck growth does not bring indigestion.
Britain brings the gloom to global defence party,"China has room to start easing policies curbing capital flight. Foreign exchange reserves have stabilized at $3.1 trillion, outflows have stabilised and the currency has rallied. That's thanks to the dollar's plunge - a trend exacerbated by the antics of the Trump administration – and a far stronger domestic economy. If Beijing wants to attract more foreign money into mainland stocks and bonds, it might be time to start selectively relaxing cross-border curbs."
MUFG banks on an easy ride in Indonesia,"U.S. Republicans are pursuing the holy grail of Washington policy: tax reform. The last comprehensive overhaul was in 1986 under Ronald Reagan. The Exchange met with Reagan adviser Art Laffer, known as the father of supply-side economics, to discuss the prospects for reform today."
Equifax hack damage is only the start,"From a global perspective, the political crisis in Lower Saxony, which was triggered by the defection of a Green parliamentarian, looks a storm in a teacup. But for investors in Volkswagen, a snap election in the German state due in October could be a turning point for political meddling in the carmaker."
Viewsroom: Broadcom $130 bln bid signals market top,"The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to move ahead with a resolution disapproving of a Trump administration plan to ease sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal , its parent En+ and power firm EuroSibEnergo."
ECB haste risks slowing its bad-loan cleanup,"At a local Connecticut package store, a six-pack of Sapporo goes for $10.49. For a dollar more, tipplers can take home a half-dozen bottles of Anchor Steam. There's no easy way to explain why one brand deserves a 10 percent premium. Both are brewed domestically, and from venerable producers founded within years of each other, in Hokkaido and San Francisco, respectively. Anchor Steam's ability to charge more, however, may explain why Sapporo plunked down $85 mil"
China gives foreigners second swing at cash piñata,"Elon Musk is an entrepreneur in a bubble. Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla’s turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, the founder opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel."
Singles' Day is shop window for Alibaba's new toys,"Chinese investors are buying into a London skyline that is past its peak. Two landmark skyscrapers in the city’s financial district have recently been sold to Hong Kong-based bidders. The sky-high prices put pressure on yields at a time when Britain’s departure from the European Union is threatening rents. Still, it is a safer bet than investing at home."
Trump says he will let Justice Department decide handling of Mueller report,"The signals are good for a huge telecoms infrastructure listing. China Tower, owner of the world’s biggest collection of telecoms towers, is preparing an initial public offering in Hong Kong of up to $10 billion, Reuters says. At the right price, it should be well received."
Pompeo says Trump-Kim summit to be held somewhere in Asia,"Neymar da Silva Santos Junior achieved several milestones this week. The Brazilian forward became the world’s most expensive footballer following his 222 million euro ($263 million) move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain. He also entered the mergers and acquisitions league tables. His transfer ranks among the 30 largest ever purchases of a Brazilian asset by a French buyer, according to Thomson Reuters data. Both feats are a sign soccer M&A has reached a new "
Senate hearings to probe unsafe housing of U.S. military families,"The Bible admonishes the unfairly smitten to turn the other cheek in order to reach paradise. Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders, who have borne repeated slaps in the face in the form of heavy and recurring losses since the financial crisis, are no strangers to pain in pursuit of salvation. On Friday there was evidence that deliverance, in the form of dividends, may be nearer at hand."
Apple has deciding vote in Broadcom-Qualcomm deal,"The commodity business is often about blending different grades of coal, iron ore or crude oil. Yancoal Australia’s $2.5 billion share sale is a more exotic alloy, mixing Australian public company procedure and Chinese state capitalism."
Cox: Lisbon turns Tatooine for tech Rebel Alliance,"Questionable elections for a rubber-stamping new assembly may give President Nicolas Maduro more power. But the country’s people, economy - and some U.S. companies - will suffer. Also: Sprint, under a ton of debt yet overvalued, weighs up its M&A options."
Burberry’s risky new look rules out missteps,A pay cut for Britain’s top corporate leaders shows how setting compensation for chief executives is more of an exercise in guesswork than an exact science. The average CEO of a FTSE 100 company took home 17 percent less last year despite buoyant markets. Cutting their remuneration assuages public opinion but also underscores the problems companies face when trying to link pay with boardroom performance.

Tencent and Snap send short message to Facebook,"About 400 U.S. Food and Drug Administration staffers have returned to their posts from furlough, including some food inspectors and support professionals, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a tweet on Tuesday."
M&S swaps comfort food for tougher diet,"Rising political tensions could derail a Chinese bid for MoneyGram International. Markets are pricing in an increasing risk that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration will stymie a $1.2 billion takeover by Ant Financial, the payments firm controlled by Alibaba founder Jack Ma. That would send a nasty message to Beijing at the expense of MoneyGram investors."
Hong Kong's IPO market is turning Chinese,Sprint is busy working the lines. Chief Executive Marcelo Claure signaled on Tuesday that an announcement about a merger is coming soon. The company’s stock price jumped 11 percent on the prospect. News reports have run the gamut of possible partners for the No. 4 U.S. cellular carrier. What’s less certain is if any of them will pick up the phone.
Bill Ackman is losing his touch,"Even strong athletes can be hobbled by unexpected twinges of pain. All the more so European banks, which are still on the path to recovery. Société Générale and Commerzbank on Wednesday became the latest to say that they had been hurt by difficult trading conditions in the second quarter. The volatility of revenues from this business risks masking banks’ improving fitness."
ABF's sweet tooth will weigh on valuation,Baidu rival Sogou is planning an initial public offering in the United States. But convincing investors to back a distant number two in China’s mobile-search market could be tricky. Sogou’s relationship with backer Tencent will be key.
Hong Kong tech fervour defies Western IPO wobbles,Discovery's cable deal rests on some rosy assumptions. The producer of “Shark Week” is buying Food Network and HGTV owner Scripps Networks Interactive for $14.6 billion. Cost savings won’t cover the premium and getting distributors to pony up for more content will be a hard sell in a churning media market.
Trump slams U.S. intelligence chiefs as 'passive and naive' on Iran,"A quartet of embattled Chinese dealmakers may be forced to hold an overseas yard sale. Officials want Anbang Insurance to sell off its offshore empire, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Meanwhile, Reuters reports the property-to-cinema firm Dalian Wanda is blocked from refinancing offshore subsidiaries. In contrast, HNA Group says it remains keen on ousted White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci's hedge fund-investment firm, SkyBridge. But pending deals are likely "
U.S. lawmakers request info from insulin makers on rising prices,"Snap's messages may disappear, but one thing could yet endure from its calamitous initial public offering: an incentive to treat shareholders more fairly. Inspired by investor discomfort over founder Evan Spiegel's decision to hoard all his company's voting rights for himself and a few of his bros, the compilers of America's most influential stock benchmark will henceforth bar multiple share classes. It's a victory for democratic capitalism."
U.S. lawmakers again seek to end U.S. support for Saudis in Yemen,"A quartet of embattled Chinese dealmakers may be forced to hold an overseas yard sale. Officials want Anbang Insurance to sell off its offshore empire, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Disney-Fox mashup would truly be over the top,"President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday’s vote for a new Constituent Assembly would bring peace to the country, but the immediate impact is likely to be expanded U.S. sanctions. Fresh trade measures by Washington may embolden opposition to Maduro, including from the military. That offers hope for Venezuelans, but American companies like Phillips 66 and Chevron would share the costs."
Broadcom faces down ghost of chip LBOs past,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingview) - Mark Tucker inherits a bank that is approaching fighting fitness. HSBC’s new chairman, who is due to join the global lender’s board at the beginning of September, has a reputation as a decisive manager. But first-half results suggest little need for an urgent change of direction."

Qatar Airways gets seat for any Cathay dealmaking,"Apple risks overstaying its welcome in China. The $800 billion iPhone maker has enjoyed massive success in the People's Republic compared to foreign peers. But as it pushes into cloud, payments and services, it confronts the same unpredictable regulators and local competitors that drove out the likes of Facebook and Uber."
Ritz roundup is dark side of grand Saudi ambition,"Markets are giving Barclays scant credit for its new trimmer figure. The bank is retreating from Africa, shrinking quickly to focus on its core business, and has a new returns target of 10 percent. The fuzzy timeframe to hit that goal may explain why the company’s shares trade well below its book value. Chief Executive Jes Staley can fix that by losing more fat."
Venezuela's Maduro enters alternate reality,"A recovery at Baidu buys time for reinvention. On Thursday, the Chinese web giant reported a forecast-beating jump in quarterly earnings, suggesting its core search business is rebounding. This gives Baidu more room to focus on mobile services and artificial intelligence."
Europe’s IPO failures are a problem overshared,The open road in front of Amazon has few bumps. The $500 billion internet retailer reported top-line growth up a riveting 25 percent to $38 billion in the second quarter. Investors will fret about the sky-high valuation in relation to a bottom line that plunged 77 percent from a year earlier to under $200 million in the quarter. But feedback loops within the company keep rivals at bay.
Abe best off keeping Trump out of economic rough,"CEO Mike Corbat pledged a huge earnings boost at the bank’s first investor confab in nine years. But Citi’s enduring crisis hangover will still leave it trailing most rivals. In China, HNA’s shadowy ownership may be a big problem for U.S. M&A. Plus: Google keeps clicking."
Viewsroom: Saudi Arabia's city of the future,"On the July feast day of Vereda del Carmen's patron saint, a priest accompanied by an acolyte bearing a chalice of holy water traverses the rutted dirt track that links the village with the rest of Colombia and the world. The cleric showers water from his aspergillum on pickup trucks alongside the road, their hoods popped up and windows rolled down to receive the blessing."
Botched Republican pitch bodes ill for tax cuts,"Lloyds is a good bank in a bad place: Britain. The UK lender beat earnings expectations in the second quarter. The productivity of its loan book is rising and costs are falling relative to income. If it weren’t for fears about Britain’s exit from the European Union, and a seemingly bottomless pit of charges for past bad behaviour, Lloyds could be worth 10 percent more. Sadly, what is matters more to investors than what might be."
U.S. federal contractors fight for back pay after shutdown,"Royal Dutch Shell is great at producing profit, but less so at producing oil. The Anglo-Dutch energy giant has more than tripled its earnings in the second quarter, helped by the strong performance of its downstream refining business and recovering prices. With its debt falling too, the company is doing the right things for shareholders – except in the crucial area of pumping more fuel."
"Congress holds first hearings on insulin, high drug prices","The American crackdown on Hong Kong auditors won't change much. U.S. regulators have revoked the registration of a mid-sized auditor after it refused to share the papers of an unnamed mainland issuer, on orders from Beijing - the second such punishment against a Hong Kong accountant. This sanction won't sting the target, nor does it resolve bigger problems in a weak U.S.-China audit agreement. Unfortunately renegotiation seems unlikely."
Senate committee delays vote on Trump's attorney general pick,"It’s time for Facebook to start looking beyond Madison Avenue. The social network beat profit estimates in the latest quarter as more brands sought to reach its 2 billion users. Yet the torrid pace of revenue growth is cooling off, mobile’s share of advertising has limited upside, and regulators are increasingly questioning the company’s dominance."
Bank of England rate hike has dismal logic,"A top U.S. lawmaker launched an investigation into pharmaceutical industry pricing practices on Monday, less than a week after he and fellow Democrats introduced legislation aimed at lowering medicine prices."
Northern Ireland crisis risks economy and UK unity,"The ballooning market for so-called initial coin offerings – which has boomed to $1.3 billion so far this year – just got a reality check. The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided that last year’s largest sale of crypto-currency tokens, reminiscent of an initial public offering of shares, was indeed a sale of securities and should have complied with U.S. laws governing the process and protecting investors."
Exchange Podcast: Ellen Pao,"Primary dealers are an odd choice for Europe’s next financial land-grab. Officials in the EU may force banks who buy sovereign debt directly to move some jobs out of London after Brexit to retain the privilege, Reuters reported on Wednesday. This could make a business whose appeal is dwindling even less attractive."
Cox: Saudi crown prince revealed his magic number,"A takeover of ITV seems an increasingly plausible plot twist. Shares in the UK broadcaster, which recently named budget airline easyJet’s Carolyn McCall as its next chief executive, have fallen about 15 percent in three months. Yet the company doesn’t look any less valuable, especially to a bidder prepared to brave a slowdown in the troubled free-to-air TV advertising market."

Dubai demonstrates the distance ahead of Saudi,"Is it wise to run in Jimmy Choos? Michael Kors is going to try. The U.S. brand’s $1.2 billion bid for the UK-listed luxury shoemaker will require it to supercharge sales, elevate margins and find synergies. The buyer’s track record shows that is achievable, but at risk of taking the brand downmarket."
StanChart has yet to reward shareholders’ patience,HNA Group’s web still looks tangled. A restructuring of the Chinese conglomerate’s shareholding structure only goes so far in allaying concerns about opacity.
Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins,"Fintech's faithful are putting payments on a pedestal. Square and PayPal shares are near all-time highs – as are those of venerable outfits like Visa, MasterCard and First Data. They’re each chasing what could be a $2.3 trillion revenue business by 2019, according to McKinsey. But they can’t all be winners."
Aetna lays out its insurance value for CVS,"Alphabet’s opacity is hindering Google's antitrust fight. Despite huge efforts outside its core online search business, the $685 billion juggernaut still looks like a one-trick pony with nearly 90 percent of revenue coming from ad sales. Shedding more light on its autonomous vehicle, YouTube, biotech and other promising ventures might comfort investors about the looming risks of antitrust regulation. It could also help them look past short-term hiccups, like th"
Democrats still push Trump on Rusal sanctions deal,"WebMD's rollup strategy finally got a second opinion. Back in 1999, the online healthcare-information publisher united with another fledging rival in a deal that was backed by Microsoft, Intel and others. KKR is now buying the dot-com survivor for $2.8 billion, far less than the internet-frenzied stock-swap valuation. This fresh merger with Internet Brands may work out better."
Bolton's notes raise questions on U.S. military plans amid Venezuela tensions,U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Saturday he will force a vote soon on a resolution to disapprove the Trump administration's decision to relax sanctions on three Russian companies connected to oligarch Oleg Deripaska.
Senator McConnell would support bill making shutdowns more difficult,"Are Germany’s carmakers embroiled in a cartel bigger than the supersized Audi Q7 SUV? That’s the suggestion from a report in Der Spiegel magazine, suggesting that Audi, VW, Porsche, Daimler and BMW colluded to slow down innovation and limit the effectiveness of emission cleaning technology. The reality may prove more prosaic. On one level, carmakers are in need of more collaboration, not less."
Hadas: Martin Luther's unexpected business legacy,"Japan’s reform momentum is under threat. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s approval ratings have crashed, ending a period of unusual political stability. The response is more likely to be populist spending than making further painful, but necessary, structural changes to the world’s third-largest economy."
Burberry can lose kid gloves along with Bailey,"A case of puppy love just swept over the stock market. After Snap, Blue Apron and YogaWorks appeared to spell doom for initial public offerings of trendy, fast-growing businesses, shares of PetIQ jumped by a third in their Friday debut after having priced at the top of the range. A more sensible valuation helped the maker of canine treats and medicine, but it also may have wagged the dog."
Twin tailwinds help Ryanair weather pilot crisis,"Private equity groups are rushing to bet on financial technology. Permira, Advent and Bain have all recently announced acquisitions of payment processors in the hope of capitalising on the cashless zeitgeist. Blackstone and CVC, which just offered $3.7 billion for UK-listed Paysafe, are placing a double wager."
Constellation Brands takes the party up a notch,Traders push the euro up at their own peril. The single currency’s recent broad-based strength risks depressing import prices when inflation is still too low. Any hint that a stronger exchange rate could prompt European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to leave monetary policy loose for longer will force the euro back down again.
Axalta deal complicates Akzo's juggling act,"Blackstone is more famous as a seller to Asian buyers than a private equity investor in the region. That could all be about to change. The firm plans to raise up to $3 billion for its first Asia private equity fund and could raise more, according to Reuters. The timing looks smart, but it won’t be a cakewalk."

U.S. economy doing just fine without tax cuts,"Republicans’ failure to replace Obamacare throws into doubt Washington’s ability to keep other high-profile election promises, not least cutting corporate levies. Meanwhile, President Trump’s fuzzy agenda for reforming NAFTA could give Canada and Mexico more bargaining power."
HSBC investors to new CEO: more of the same please,"Central banking increasingly looks like an act of faith. The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, and his Bank of Japan counterpart Haruhiko Kuroda have spent trillions of euros and yen without generating as much inflation as they want. Yet they have little choice but to insist their policies will eventually work."
Ping An's tech dreams far from assured,"Unilever is half way there on its Kraft Heinz challenge. The Anglo-Dutch owner of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream cut costs faster than expected in the first half of the year by reducing ad spend and paying its suppliers less. Its 20 percent operating margin target looks reachable. Yet with U.S. rival Kraft Heinz free to go hostile next month, volume growth remains too low for comfort."
Clariant-Huntsman gives way to post-activism chill,A union that represents thousands of U.S. air traffic controllers filed a lawsuit against the federal government on Friday claiming its failure to pay the workers during an ongoing partial government shutdown could endanger passengers' safety.
Trump ally Roger Stone arrested for lying to U.S. Congress,"For easyJet, losing a chief executive is manageable. While Carolyn McCall, who has taken up the top spot at British broadcaster ITV, was the mastermind of the UK airline’s steep ascent over the past seven years, she leaves behind a financially and strategically sound company that can cope with a spell on autopilot."
"Factbox: Guilty pleas, indictments abound in Trump-Russia probe",China's e-commerce giant is abandoning its unique selling point. Alibaba is trumpeting a push into bricks-and-mortar shopping. It’s not alone but the stakes are particularly high for the $392 billion giant led by Jack Ma as it marks a reversal of the asset-light model which fuelled its extraordinary profitability. 
Pentagon declines to say whether Colombia option exists,"James Gorman is teaching rival Wall Street boss Lloyd Blankfein the benefits of diversity. Stabilizing the fixed-income trading unit isn’t the only way his Morgan Stanley showed Goldman Sachs its tail for the second quarter in a row. His growing capital-light wealth unit helped, too."
China's Baidu stumbles in getting back to basics,"BBC stars will be the main winners from radical pay transparency. The British public broadcaster has bowed to government pressure by naming the 96 presenters and journalists who earned more than 150,000 pounds ($195,000) in the last financial year. As with chief executives of public companies, disclosing compensation will probably just enable them to demand more."
Aetna bid is a defensive prescription for CVS,"Reckitt Benckiser is showing bigger rivals how it’s done. The British company has agreed to sell its food unit, home to French’s Mustard, for a spicy $4.2 billion to U.S. food group McCormick – a premium to what it looks to be worth, even with no recovery story and limited cost synergies. With buyers this hungry, less efficient peers Unilever and Nestlé ought to emulate the Reckitt recipe."
Comcast earns its peacock feathers,"Australian banks should be able to absorb the latest regulatory uppercut. The local financial watchdog has aggressively hiked minimum capital requirements for top lenders, the latest step in a campaign to better protect the country from financial shocks. The caution is warranted given the finance sector's concentration - and record household debt levels. A grace period will make it easier for banks to meet the new rules. But outsized returns could be a thing of the past."
Viewsroom: China's leader cements his power,"The U.S. Treasury’s recent 147-page report, ""A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities,"" details a rollback of many of the measures imposed to make banking safe and sound after the financial crisis. The proposals include substantial weakening of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform law. At the same time, White House appointments to several bank regulatory agencies are likely to promote measures that result in reductions in bank compliance costs, capital"

Saudi utopia plan is so bonkers it just might work,"Who cares about a few bad weeks in fixed-income markets? JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon raised the reasonable question last week. The answer is Lloyd Blankfein at rival Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, which on Tuesday reported a 40 percent year-on-year slump in revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Goldman’s market compass is a little off, and investors may soon expect Blankfein to fix it more quickly."
Beijing's dollar bonds seek to reprice China risk,The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee may have just been given the summer off. An unexpected drop in UK inflation in June could grant rate-setters more time to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Banks score hollow victory in class-action win,U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Washington to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at one of the country's consulates in Turkey and vowed that Congress would act if the Trump administration did not.
China’s autocracy puts end to reform illusions,"China's innovation bubble is rapidly losing air. Investors, hearing President Xi Jinping signal for a crackdown on financial risk, are speeding their flight from expensive technology stocks and small caps into traditional economy blue chips. The overheated early-stage startup space might be next."
Lloyds capital gusher suffers regulatory blockage,"Netflix has proved again that it has a way of triggering a Pavlovian response from its shareholders. The video-streaming service on Monday unveiled second-quarter results that show it added more subscribers than expected. It also grew operating income faster than revenue. That sent shares soaring, even though expected profitability falls a long way short of being able to justify the stock’s fairy-tale multiple."
"Shutdown over, Senate advances Middle East bill","Corporate agitator Nelson Peltz is opting for the close shave at Procter & Gamble. Unlike his last proxy fight at DuPont, the activist’s Trian Partners, which owns a $3.3 billion stake, is taking a more surgical approach to the $223 billion razors-to-detergent company, lobbying for a single board seat. Trian is also dangling niceties, like promising to support management and not calling for a breakup. Given Procter’s myriad challenges, shareholders would be silly"
"Trump, Pelosi agree on Feb. 5 for State of the Union address","Gross domestic product grew 6.9 percent in the second quarter, beating expectations and capping a solid first half. Robust manufacturing, foreign demand, strong commodities and a softer dollar have lent the government time to attack bad debt and get housing prices under control. Naysayers have been silenced for now. But while confidence is warranted, complacency is not. "
Shutdown costs pegged at $3 billion as government reopens,"Amazon.com's real-life game of monopoly will come to feel just as endless as the board-game version. The e-commerce titan's plan to buy upscale grocery chain Whole Foods triggered fresh fears of its dominance. For the time being, consumers and investors probably keep winning."
Xi's new stature can overawe China's market forces,"Britain’s 5G auction is wisely putting customers before the country’s coffers. Regulators on Tuesday capped incumbent BT’s participation in upcoming mobile-spectrum sales, potentially hitting the Treasury’s income from the sales. It’s a reasonable trade-off in order to ensure a competitive four-player telecoms market."
Xi's new stature can overawe China's market forces,"Sacred cows are blessing India's chicken industry. Shares of midcap poultry specialist Venky's, part of a group that also owns British football club Blackburn Rovers, have risen around 440 percent this year fuelled in part by a campaign against beef consumption. Although the Supreme Court on July 11 suspended a recent government ban on cattle slaughter, the country's rising middle class will remain hungry for the birds."
Republican tax-reform hopes have yet to hit reality,"Tesla’s CEO is putting the firm’s reputation, and $50 mln, on the line in a deal to quickly provide energy storage to South Australia. Over in Texas, a battle is brewing between investment icons Warren Buffett and Paul Singer over a long-suffering and oft-wooed energy company."
UniCredit gets head start on recovery path,"There's a time-honored tradition for new chief executives to start the job with a kitchen-sinking. The idiomatic expression seems to derive from the idea that when selling a home, everything that's not affixed to the plumbing can be carted off. In the business context, bosses rip out the approaches of their predecessors, including sometimes even the proverbial washbasin. Donald Trump's attempt to apply the strategy to the American presidency isn't working."
Cox: Aramco clouds Saudi's coming-out party,Where does an 800 pound gorilla sit? Anywhere it wants to. The old joke also applies to giant companies such as Saudi Aramco. The UK regulator has proposed changes that would make it easier for the state-controlled oil group to offer its shares in London. But making policy for a single company – especially one this large – is a mistake.
GE has become the ultimate industrial lightweight,"U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday rebuked President Donald Trump for threatening to block disaster aid for California, a state recently ravaged by deadly, destructive wildfires whose mostly Democratic political leaders often spar with the Republican president."
Italy's north teaches Catalonia a self-rule lesson,"Google isn’t liable for 1.1 billion euros ($1.25 billion) of back-taxes after all, a French court has decided. That won’t be the last battle the U.S. search engine faces over how it arranges its profits. Giant technology companies will always have an advantage over local tax authorities, though. Unlike competing European countries, they can put their global interest first."
Abe wins mandate to give Japan a raise,"Hong Kong's latest gaming initial public offering is not Razer sharp. The U.S.-Singaporean firm, which makes gaming keyboards and mice, is eyeing a valuation of up to $5 billion in a listing later this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing a source. While the broader industry in which this company operates is hot, the financial reality of Razer is underwhelming."
Daimler’s reform drive lacks horsepower,"Only in Trumpland can Gary Cohn be considered a suitable Federal Reserve chairman. The former Goldman Sachs president and current White House adviser has been tipped as top contender to replace Janet Yellen, Politico reported. Though not a trained economist, Cohn's years in finance put him ahead of other Donald Trump cabinet picks notably lacking relevant résumés. But a Wall Street trader's temperament makes a bad match for the staid central-bank job."
PBOC’s Zhou seeks lasting sway with debt warning,"They don’t understand how the economy really works. That’s a legitimate criticism of many of the protesters who tried to disrupt last week’s G20 meeting of world leaders in Hamburg, Germany. It is also a reasonable comment about the explanations which professional economists would typically offer the malcontents. That similarity was noted at a much smaller, if less raucous, meeting last week of a group of rebellious economic thinkers who gathered for a two-day se"
U.S. farmers receive almost $6 billion in trade aid to date: USDA,"What makes for a healthy job market? Low unemployment and generous, rising wages are a good start. There’s more to it, though. A government-backed study on Britain’s working practices published on Tuesday begins to ask the right questions about what the labour market should do – and how not to think about work."
Former Starbucks CEO considering independent White House bid,"Singapore's garage sale highlights a global capital problem. State investor Temasek sold more assets last year than it bought, its annual report published on Tuesday showed. It is the first time the equity-focused investor has made a net divestment since 2009. With stock market valuations high and stiff competition for assets, this trend looks set to continue."
Partial U.S. government shutdown cost economy $3 billion: budget office,"Why didn't any Wall Street bigwigs go to jail over the 2008 financial crisis? ProPublica reporter Jesse Eisinger argues that's because prosecutors joined ""The Chickenshit Club,"" which is also the title of his new book."
PayPal’s future rests on striking quadruple whammy,"Paul Singer is testing Warren Buffett's adherence to his own investing wisdom. The hedge-fund chief's Elliott Management has cobbled a proposal to extract Texas electricity provider Energy Future Holdings from bankruptcy, challenging Berkshire Hathaway's $9 billion deal. Even if the rival plan is a stretch, the Oracle of Omaha famously eschews competitive processes."
Verizon stuck in neutral as rivals shift,"A landmark review of Britain’s jobs market has come out kinder to employers than workers. The government-backed study, proposing better rights for gig workers and changes to tax, hits some helpful notes. It stops short, though, of calling for business to bear more of the cost of a highly flexible workforce. That is a realistic reflection of the United Kingdom’s weaker bargaining power."
Exchange Podcast: Scott Galloway,"Blackstone's diversification drive is circling home. Over the years, the group run by Stephen Schwarzman has expanded far beyond its leveraged-buyout roots. Now it’s using capital that had been focused on hedge funds to take a stake in rival private-equity firm Leonard Green. The return comparisons are too stark to ignore."
"ICOs validate old-school ""follow the money"" mantra","About 1,000 furloughed federal workers have turned to online fundraising to help cover their expenses as a partial shutdown of the U.S. government drags on for nearly three weeks, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe.com said on Wednesday."
Hadas: Time to slay the free market-myth monster,"TalkTalk’s focus on cheap may not be cheerful. The UK broadband provider’s founder and largest shareholder Charles Dunstone wants to grow the business by focusing on value for money. That’s risky in a competitive market, and endangers profitability. The alternative – finding a buyer – could be tricky given the company’s rich valuation."
Unilever struggle gives hope to predators,"GIC’s shrinking returns are adding gloom to Singapore. The sovereign wealth fund, which manages an estimated $343 billion of assets, has delivered its worst annual performance since 2001 barring the financial crisis. The outlook is depressing too. The challenges of investing overseas compound the mood at home as the city's first family feud in an ugly public squabble."
China’s leaders make peace with its old economy,"Warren Buffett’s folksy charm may come in especially handy for his Oncor encore. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is taking a second stab at the Texas electricity provider and its parent company, Energy Future, six years after a $2 billion investment led to hefty losses. Two other suitors previously failed to reach accord with regulators, however. Creditors, too, may require some sweet talk."
Global watchdogs may curb U.S. deregulatory push,"The rewards of music’s digital-streaming renaissance are unevenly spread. Big labels like Universal are booming, while listeners can access tens of millions of songs through relatively affordable services like Spotify. Yet as problems at Germany’s SoundCloud highlight, the loss-making streamers themselves have yet to prove they have an independent future alongside tech rivals such as Apple and Amazon."
Mistimed writedowns lesser of mining M&A evils,"India's bond market deserves a good whipping. Ajay Tyagi, the straight-talking new chairman of the country's securities regulator, is cracking down on the fast-growing corporate bond market following a spate of scandals. With a large chunk of new issues coming from companies in dubious financial health, it is wise to force the market to raise standards."
Indonesia's slowdown belies Jakarta's reform spin,It’s 20 years since the British handed the island and adjacent territory back to the mainland. Breakingviews’ Asia columnists explain how Hong Kong’s economy and society have changed and ask whether this once-dominant regional financial center can regain some of its lost luster.
'Broken man': Right wing rips Trump over no-wall shutdown deal,"John Malone is papering over the challenges facing his television-shopping businesses. The media baron’s Liberty Interactive is taking full control of HSN in a $2.1 billion deal. Bringing the cable retailer under the same corporate umbrella as his QVC unit makes sense, and investors should end up with something more valuable than a tracking stock. But a complex share swap won’t solve the problems plaguing the two networks."
An end to shutdown leaves federal workers still feeling insecure,"It’s taken more than a year, but British policymakers are finally publicly articulating a pragmatic approach to Brexit. Andrew Bailey, head of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, on Thursday set out a blueprint for continued free trade in financial services after Britain leaves the European Union. Even if UK politicians belatedly buy into the idea, their European equivalents have reasons to resist."
Explainer: How Congress will negotiate border security deal,"It is hard to let go of a unicorn. Indian e-commerce firm Snapdeal has rejected a roughly $850 million takeover offer from its larger rival Flipkart, a person familiar with the situation told Breakingviews. A sale at this price would fall short of the startup industry’s magical $1 billion-plus mark, let alone the peak valuation of $6.5 billion Snapdeal hit more than a year ago. But the rebuff is probably a mistake: buyers are scarce and a delay is only likely to "
Viewsroom: President Xi Jinping’s moment,"Worldpay discovered on Wednesday that a couple of birds in the bush are sometimes worth a bit more than one in the hand. A day after Britain’s biggest payment processor said it had received approaches from both Vantiv and JPMorgan, the company plumped for the former’s offer of nearly $10 billion in a mix of cash and shares. That took the shine off the share price of both the buyer and its target. Perhaps because the deal only makes sense with some very charitable"
Goldman pips Morgan Stanley on style not substance,"Billionaire donor and liberal activist Tom Steyer, who has led an effort to impeach President Donald Trump, announced on Wednesday he will not seek the Democratic presidential nomination and instead will continue his effort to oust the president."
"Heads or tails, Mark Carney loses","Volvo has just given Tesla a shock. The Sweden-based carmaker on Wednesday said it will stop producing new gasoline-only engines from 2019 and shift to a variety of hybrid and all-electric models. That may not appear too significant at first – the company, after all, accounted for just 0.6 percent of global vehicle sales last year. But its plan sums up the challenges faced by Elon Musk’s firm."
Credit Suisse breakup faces trading conundrum,"The system of political and economic openness built after World War Two is under threat, Bill Emmott argues in his new book ""The Fate of the West."" He joins us to discuss globalization, populism and why there's still cause for optimism about the future of liberal democracies."
Guest view: Chinese oil can fuel North Korea talks,"Tencent's e-books require some Hollywood stardust. The tech giant's publishing arm may raise up to $800 million in a Hong Kong listing, according to IFR. Catering to bookworms isn't very lucrative, even if more and more readers are paying for electronic literature. The real payoff will lie in turning stories into blockbuster films, video games and merchandise."
Cox: Next Fed chair will need unusually thick skin,"Sino-U.S. relations are entering a dangerous phase. The honeymoon between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump ended abruptly, and the latter feels sore. China hasn't delivered change in North Korea, and trade is still imbalanced. Now the U.S. administration is lashing out. The likelihood of miscalculation is rising, as is the risk of economic fallout."
Netflix valuation outstrips burgeoning opportunity,British Prime Minister Theresa May has the chance to make a virtue of political necessity. Her fragile minority government is under mounting pressure to spend more on a range of fronts. Loosening the purse strings would help both the economy and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.
Nordstrom sale season may be long time coming,British Prime Minister Theresa May has the chance to make a virtue of political necessity. Her fragile minority government is under mounting pressure to spend more on a range of fronts. Loosening the purse strings would help both the economy and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.
Europe poorly placed for Austria’s rightward drift,"Even if Saudi Arabia and Qatar can patch up their differences, greater economic cooperation in the region appears unworkable.  The kingdom and its allies have granted Doha two more days to meet their list of 13 demands. Failure to reach a deal could escalate the dispute, further hitting investors and regional economies. But even a compromise would be unlikely to patch up divisions between the Gulf’s Arab states."
Microfinance goes mainstream in India,British Prime Minister Theresa May has the chance to make a virtue of political necessity.

Senate leader looks for Friday vote to reopen government,"Naspers has an unhealthy addiction to Tencent. The South African company is worth $28 billion less than its stake in the Chinese gaming behemoth. Boss Bob van Dijk rules out a spinoff, but that would be the best fix. Unfortunately for would-be activists, supervoting shares make it hard to apply pressure."
Leading Democrats to hold news conference on shutdown deal,"“I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of twenty pounds”. Curious British children sometimes ask their parents the meaning of this statement, printed on every 20 pound note. Befuddled elders can find the answer in the excellent “Making Money: Coin, Currency and the Coming of Capitalism” by Christine Desan."
Schumer says U.S. shutdown to end on Friday after deal with Trump,U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he has a right to declare a national emergency if no deal with Congress can be reached on government funding legislation that includes money for a southern border wall.
Communist Party assault muddles Chinese capitalism,"In early 2009, fund managers at PIMCO coined the term “new normal” to describe the post-crisis financial landscape. Their projection of sluggish growth, subdued inflation and rock-bottom interest rates proved a reliable guide for most of the next eight years. Now markets are taking fright over a hint that that period is coming to an end."
Warning signs flash at Samsung after big quarter,"Trouble in Hong Kong’s ""Enigma Network"" calls into question official efforts to encourage more small-cap listings. Investors were already increasingly wary about smaller stocks. Restoring trust will take stronger rules and better enforcement."
Sky investors choose between profit and principles,"Walgreens Boots Alliance has at least salvaged something from the wreckage of its deal to buy rival U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid. After antitrust pushback on the full-strength $9.4 billion deal, Walgreens has abandoned it and is instead buying over 2,000 of Rite Aid's stores for $5.2 billion. For Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina, doing about half the deal with half the benefits is something – but it's a modest return on at least 20 months' work."
Viewsroom: Activists keep the fight alive,"The meal-kit delivery firm had an unappetizing IPO, barely opening above its much-reduced price of $10 a share.

Facebook could do with more Sheryl Sandberg,"Now that Citigroup has aced the Federal Reserve’s latest stress test, it needs a strategy. The $188 billion U.S. bank doubled its dividend and boosted its share buyback by $15.6 billion after clearing the exam. Chief Executive Mike Corbat has been understandably laser-focused on returning capital and appeasing watchdogs, objectives that eluded his predecessor and lifted him into the job. Spurring growth to match bigger investor payouts is a trickier challenge"
Wall Street bank owners too optimistic on taxes,Rupert Murdoch’s latest promises lack credibility. The media mogul’s 21st Century Fox offered concessions to protect the independence of Sky’s news arm in an attempt to secure UK government approval for its 11.7 billion pound bid for full control of the pay-TV company. Murdoch’s history of editorial meddling makes such pledges unconvincing.
Exchange Podcast: Luke Bronin,Sycamore Partners had better be ready to roll up its sleeves. The private equity firm is buying Staples for $6.9 billion. Handing over a near-20 percent premium for the struggling office supplies retailer looks foolhardy.
UK energy cap is bad economics and poor politics,"Private equity's cup runneth over. Apollo Global Management just accumulated the largest single pool of capital earmarked for buyouts, at $23.5 billion. The haul adds to a growing stockpile of dry powder that could make outsized returns harder to come by. With yields so low across most markets, however, it should be easier to make fund investors happy."
Beijing’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech,"Who'd be in charge of a corporate IT network with hacks, phishing and now a double dose of so-called ransomware to contend with? Wednesday's cyber attack hit targets from Ukraine to the United States and more than 60 other countries. Human error enables hacking of today's network setups. A shift to the cloud reduces that danger, but brings others."
Goldman necessity mothers M&A invention,"Central banks are gradually waking up to what should be their most important challenge. That’s the good news. The bad news is that the best way they have to address this challenge may not help much, and is economically dangerous and politically unpopular. Doing nothing, though, is even more hazardous."
House to release all Russia probe transcripts: Schiff,President Donald Trump said in a televised address on Tuesday that a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico is a critical part of border security and was needed to break a cycle of illegal immigration from Latin America that hurts mainly women and children.
Trump to back short-term government funding bill: reports,"Asset managers are uncompetitive, too profitable and don’t think enough about investors in their funds. Those are the broad findings of a nineteen-month probe by Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, published on Wednesday. Those conclusions, mostly previewed in an earlier report last November, hit harder than the watchdog’s prescriptions. The big question is whether, once managers have been whipped into shape, clients will become more discerning."
Trump expected to make announcement on shutdown later on Friday: CNN,"China is flunking the soft-power test with Hong Kong. President Xi Jinping will visit the city to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of its triumphant return to Chinese control. But Beijing’s grip over hearts and minds in Hong Kong is weakening. That is a problem, since this a primarily ethnically Chinese, ruthlessly pragmatic city - people who one would expect to be sympathetic."
Hadas: Economists need more psychological abuse,"The mayor of Milan celebrated his first year in office as authorities completed Italy's largest bank bailout.

Helping Santander helps UK bank competition,"Mark Carney seems to prefer scalpels to sledge hammers. Forcing banks to hold bigger capital buffers, as the Bank of England governor did on Tuesday, is a finely honed way of reining in frothy consumer finance. But eventually Carney and his colleagues will have to push through the higher borrowing costs they keep warning lenders about."
Syngenta puts Beijing’s unspoken promises to test,"A lurch by U.S. cable giants Comcast and Charter Communications into mobile telephony is bound for crossed wires. The two dominant operators are in talks with wireless carrier Sprint that may include a range of options from the use of airwaves to an outright acquisition. Wherever they end up, a ménage-à-trois involving moguls John Malone, Brian Roberts and Masayoshi Son is likely to be ungainly."
Pfizer and Glaxo may find romance over the counter,"The U.S. Senate healthcare bill lacks ""heart"" to pass in its current form. President Donald Trump wanted more of that and a less ""mean"" rollback of Obamacare. Yet the Senate spared only 1 million of the 23 million set to lose health coverage under the House plan, according to Congressional Budget Office figures. On that showing, even a Republican-only deal will need surgery."
HelloFresh IPO belongs in the deep-freeze,Britain could be handing Germany the gift of stronger growth. A scarcity of skilled workers risks slowing the pace at which Europe’s biggest economy can expand. One way to plug the gap is to attract workers who no longer feel welcome in the United Kingdom after its vote to leave the European Union.
Breakdown: Xi and China’s leadership reshuffle,China's latest logistics flotation is hard to unpack. Alibaba-backed Best Inc wants to list in New York just a few months after a rival's disappointing debut. The loss-making group is faster-growing and more diverse. But the extra complexity could make this a hard sell for already wary investors.
Harvey Weinstein saga will leave filthy handprints,"Nestle gives Dan Loeb a fresh peak to climb. The pushy billionaire boss of hedge fund Third Point has set his sights on the Swiss producer of everything from Alpo to Kit Kat and Perrier. Leviathan consumer groups have proven to be tough targets of late, both for activists and suitors. Loeb clearly likes a challenge, though, evidenced by his efforts to agitate Japanese companies to change."
HSBC’s next challenge is how to grow responsibly,"Takata’s failure is remodelling the auto-safety industry. The Japanese group has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and Japan, citing more than $10 billion of liabilities related to lethal airbags. This is a big opportunity for smaller rival Key Safety Systems, a Chinese-owned American brand which agreed in principle to buy most of the business for $1.6 billion."

Cox: P&G counting on an investor electoral college,"Invited to review a book or two on the financial crisis for an economics journal in 2011, Andrew Lo found the ones he read unsatisfying. Their gaps and inconsistencies failed to tell the full story, prompting him to extend his search. When an editor finally called time a year later, Lo submitted a review of 21 books."

Ex-Trump lawyer Cohen subpoenaed by Senate panel: adviser,"For mainland Chinese, a visit to Hong Kong feels like a voyage back in time. At home they spend weeks without a visiting an ATM or a bank. They use mobile wallets to pay for meals, bills and cabs, or even donate to beggars; they invest their unused balance in money-market funds, still using their smartphone. But when they cross the border into the special administrative region, they leave such conveniences behind."
Florida's secretary of state resigns after blackface photo surfaces,"In a sense, Blackstone is back where it started. On June 22, 2007, at what turned out to be a market peak, Steve Schwarzman and Pete Peterson took their private-equity firm public in a ballyhooed transaction that inspired rivals to do the same. A decade on, the firm's units are trading only just above the $31 price where they sold ahead of their New York Stock Exchange debut. A better result over the next 10 years could require Blackstone to financially re-engi"

Economic odds stacked against Catalonia breakaway,"In the year since Britain voted to leave the European Union, cities as diverse as Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid and even scrappy Wroclaw, Poland, have pitched their attractions to banks, investment funds and multinational companies pondering whether to shift all or parts of their operations to the continent. Milan is a relative laggard. But fashionable lateness is a Lombard charm, and there are others that make the Italian city a dark-horse candidate in the "
Yahoo’s corpse keeps festering at Verizon,"Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick has quit as chief executive under a cloud of business and cultural troubles, including harassment allegations. These threaten the ride-hailing service's eye-popping, and currently unwarranted, valuation of $68 billion. In addition to the shortage of senior managers after departures in recent months, he leaves a void right at the top. Using the company's own how-to guide as a template, Breakingviews imagines an Uber-like app that "
Viewsroom: Building the car for the future,"Theresa May’s softer plan for government still has a hard Brexit at its core. The quest for a parliamentary majority has forced the British prime minister to curb her ambitions for far-reaching domestic reforms. Her agenda, read out by Queen Elizabeth at the opening of parliament on Wednesday, will now focus on paving the way for leaving the European Union. Yet shaky support means even this blueprint could stay stuck on the drawing board."
Fintech deal suggests everything old is new again,"Why did the Grenfell Tower high-rise apartment block in West London burn up, killing at least 79 people? Investigations into the calamitous fire are just beginning and will probably take years to complete. But it has already exposed one persistent problem: Britain’s disastrous approach to housing."
SeaWorld a slimy meal for ex-Blackstone predator,"U.S. President Donald Trump has not made a decision on whether to declare a national emergency over his demand for border wall funding and the White House counsel's office is studying the matter, Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday."
More for China than London in Russian hydro IPO,"The list of what ails Uber is long – and has grown longer in virtual lockstep with the tenure of the ride-hailing application's founder, Travis Kalanick. His departure as chief executive amid pressure from other shareholders in the company ends the first leg of Uber's journey from startup to $70 billion enterprise to, eventually, public company. That the private firm was able to jettison its controlling shareholder suggests a small, but welcome, modicum of "
Trump gets Puerto Rico priorities in a muddle,"Rio Tinto prefers Chinese money today to Swiss cash tomorrow. Late on Tuesday, the Anglo-Australian miner's board opted for an upgraded $2.45 billion bid from Yancoal, instead of taking $100 million more from Glencore. Concerns about Chinese regulators must have played a role. The Swiss trader might need to come up with lots more money to stay in the game."
Tesco is spinning its wheels to get nowhere fast,"The fourth time is the charm for Chinese stocks. After three failed attempts, MSCI has finally decided to add mainland-listed shares to its global indexes. The move will be a relief for Beijing, which got egg on its face at previous annual reviews. But the move is largely symbolic and will generate only modest inflows to the PRC."
"Trump says if Senate leader reach deal to end shutdown, he would back it","Jefferies is plodding in Morgan Stanley’s footsteps. Like its bulge-bracket rival, the investment bank run by Richard Handler seems to have steadied its bond-trading business. Its latest earnings, released on Tuesday, also got a boost from underwriting that should bode well for the rest of Wall Street. Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman, though, has so far done a better job turning progress into profit."
Speaker Pelosi says wall 'down payment' in government funding bill not 'reasonable': MSNBC,"During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump suggested the United States revisit the gold standard. So did his rivals Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Ben Carson. Why are Americans so obsessed with the precious metal, both as a store of value and an investment? James Ledbetter swings by Times Square to discuss his new book, ""One Nation Under Gold."""
Explainer: How U.S. shutdown over border wall fight might play out,Britain's graft watchdog is serving up some lukewarm justice. The Serious Fraud Office has charged Barclays and four former employees in connection with the £11.5 billion of capital it raised in 2008 from investors including the Qatari government. The charges of false representation and unlawful financial assistance are the first to have been brought against a major UK bank and its former bosses. In the intervening decade Barclays – and the world – have moved on.
India will miss its top banking chief,"Hong Kong's next leader faces a public housing crisis. The city's real estate bubble, buoyed by low interest rates, limited supply and mainland money, is stoking unrest. Incoming Chief Executive Carrie Lam promises more affordable housing. It's better policy that's in short supply."
Nestlé can pre-empt Dan Loeb with refreshed board,"Blue Apron’s $3.2 billion float valuation could be the best dish it will produce. That's what the meal-kit service is proposing for its initial public offering, at the top of the share-price range proposed in a filing on Monday. The company loses money, though, and competition, potentially including the new Amazon.com-Whole Foods Market combo, will be tough."
Bain has advantage on WPP in Japanese ad-land spat,"Wal-Mart’s market capitalization dropped 5 percent, losing $11 billion, after Amazon.com unveiled its $14 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market on Friday. Meanwhile, Whole Foods shares closed on Friday nearly 2 percent above the agreed price, implying some investors think a rival bid could emerge. But even for Wal-Mart, that would be a stretch."
Two rights at Uber in danger of making a wrong,"Nosebleed prices on Asian buyouts leave little room for error. The region is awash with private-equity money. Yet big targets are relatively scarce. Acquisitions, especially in ultra-pricey China, will only work out for the buyers if companies can grow fast, and market multiples hold up, for years to come – an unlikely combination."
Las Vegas tragedy strikes a U.S. inured to outrage,President Donald Trump threatened to keep the U.S. government partially shut for months or years on Friday after he and Democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over Trump's request for $5.6 billion to build a wall on the Mexican border.
Central bankers’ superpowers are looking spent,"Infowars came to my hometown three years ago. Dan Bidondi, who identified himself as a reporter for the website that hawks extremist views and fake news, arrived with a video camera at the municipal center of Newtown, Connecticut, to cover a routine Board of Education meeting. Bidondi wasn't interested in hearing how a New England hamlet of 27,000 was dealing with bus schedules or budget priorities."
Catalonia crisis is painful distraction for Spain,Amazon.com just bought its way to the top of the food chain. The e-commerce titan is going whole hog for U.S. groceries with the $13.7 billion acquisition of upscale chain Whole Foods Market. Amazon's comfort with low margins and savvy in logistics make it so fearsome a rival that investors in the sector ran for cover. 
Catalonia crisis is painful distraction for Spain,"Theresa May will find dealing with Belfast no less complicated than dealing with Brussels. The UK prime minister is in talks to form a government with Northern Ireland’s main pro-British political party. Brexit was always likely to put immense pressure on Northern Ireland, and a pact between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party could make things even more tense."
Ryanair’s cheapskate reputation is its best asset,"Theresa May will find dealing with Belfast no less complicated than dealing with Brussels. The UK prime minister is in talks to form a government with Northern Ireland’s main pro-British political party. Brexit was always likely to put immense pressure on Northern Ireland, and a pact between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party could make things even more tense."
Crypto-currencies’ strength becomes their weakness,"BHP has checked the right boxes in naming former packaging executive Ken MacKenzie as chairman. The 53-year old Canadian lopped heads and boosted returns at his last job, and was unsentimental about weak business lines. Activist investor Elliott is pleased. Other shareholders should be too."
Trump delays State of the Union Address until shutdown ends,Attempts to jump-start the ride-hailing app’s toxic culture stalled after board member and TPG founder David Bonderman’s sexist joke at a company meeting about sexism. The UK grapples with Brexit under a hung parliament. And could a Chinese invasion solve the North Korea problem?
Former Vice President Biden calls for national unity,"Wells Fargo is driving its stagecoach further into the mud. The $270 billion California-based lender is facing several lawsuits alleging that it changed bankrupt borrowers’ mortgage terms without consent even as its fake-accounts scandal unfolded, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The bank now run by Tim Sloan is still struggling to get the basics right."
"Locked out of House by Pelosi, Trump vows State of Union alternative","Spain’s model bank bail-in is leaving lasting scars. The resolution of Banco Popular used new European rules to ensure that creditors, not taxpayers, picked up the bill. Investors have responded by dumping debt issued by other small peers."
Expect buybacks but not M&A from China's Sina,"Three’s no charm for legal opponents of the American president. Some 200 Democrats in Congress on Wednesday filed the third lawsuit claiming Donald Trump violated a constitutional ban on accepting presents. All the accusers face long odds, though, of proving they were hurt directly or that the suits even belong in court. Impeachment is still probably the only way for Trump's opponents to get him to fold."
TaskRabbit deal reveals what even IKEA can't build,"Chinese firms are running low on funding options. A regulatory crackdown on a surge in shadow lending is starting to bear fruit, central bank data shows. Yet corporate bond issuance has also plummeted, and regulators are slowing IPO approvals. Once again the economy risks overdependence on bank lending."
Cox: Where are the taxpayers' private jets?,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether a federal law that blocks trademarks for brand names or logos bearing profane words or sexual imagery violates free speech rights in a case involving a clothing brand called ""FUCT."""
Crypto-currencies can't salvage hedge-fund junkies,"The drama at Anbang Insurance Group could be a coda to China’s M&A craze. Late on Tuesday, the acquisitive Chinese outfit said its Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfil his duties for personal reasons. The New York Times and China’s Caijing magazine, both citing sources, said he had been detained. Decoding what is happening where mainland business meets politics is never straightforward. Still, one way to read this is as a further sign that Beij"
Hugh Hefner's stamina outlasted the Playboy model,"J.Crew may have found a clever way to mend several tears in its corporate fabric. The flailing clothier owned by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners is trying to restructure some $567 million of notes by offering holders a deal that runs the risk of irking another set of creditors. So J.Crew has stitched something up for them, too. If it manages to thread the needle, J.Crew may provide a blueprint for other wobbly retailers contemplating bankruptcy."
Google clears deck for huge antitrust fight,Britain’s messy politics is making it harder for Bank of England Governor Mark Carney to ignore a jump in inflation. The spike in prices is probably temporary and wages remain subdued. But the country’s fragile government will add to bond investors’ nerves.
Hit IPO undercuts the case for new Hong Kong board,"As co-founder and CEO of Ares, Tony Ressler oversees the management of $100 billion. During a recent conversation in Los Angeles, he talked about the bull market under President Trump, his firm's struggling investment in Neiman Marcus and the rising cost of higher education."
Electric vehicles lack killer spark - for now,"Yahoo will soon be little more than a holding company for stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. The $52 billion internet firm's shareholders on Thursday approved the sale of its operating businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.5 billion. The long-standing wrinkle, though, is that Yahoo bought the minority holdings so cheaply that essentially the entire value of both would be taxable in the United States if it sold them. That means the company is, at least in "
India walks tightrope with “black money” fight,A cross-Channel tug-of-war over derivatives regulation demonstrates the limits of Brexit. The European Commission has backed away from forcing trading in euro derivatives to leave London. But its alternative solution will require UK-based clearing houses to follow EU rules – or lose out.
College-sports fraud case obscures the real crime,Chinese biotech has revitalised Hong Kong's IPO market. Shares of WuXi Biologics popped as much as 39 percent on their debut on Tuesday. High earnings growth and a lack of exciting initial public offerings led to strong demand for the $511 million deal. This is good news for a bourse keen to attract a new breed of entrepreneurs.
Senate Democrats question offshore drilling work amid shutdown,"Shifting Uber out of reverse will be hard regardless of who's chief executive. Whether it's Travis Kalanick or anyone else, running such a sprawling enterprise is a challenge. The ride-sharing service also faces a mass exodus of senior executives, a toxic culture about to be laid bare and a business model based on inventing the future, all of which increase the degree of difficulty."
U.S. agency to extend some benefits to unpaid airport screeners,"General Electric has seen the future: it is both stateless and globalist. With the anointment of John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive, the $255 billion industrial titan appears to be doubling down on a strategy that transcends its American roots. Flannery has spent much of his career engineering growth abroad. He's also no stranger to restructuring."
Trump wants to do alternative to State of the Union address,"Britain’s warring political parties can all gain if they share the Brexit pain. The Conservative party’s loss of a majority in last week’s general election weakens its hand in talks with the European Union. Bringing Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour into talks could strengthen it, and cut the chance of a chaotic exit. If, that is, Corbyn can be persuaded to collaborate."
Botched SEC hack probe a warning for other agencies,"President Donald Trump, who has taken credit for stock market  gains, on Friday blamed the December bear market on the Democrats' winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the November elections."
Equifax can't even oust its failed CEO effectively,MSCI’s latest China plan still has some holes. The U.S. index provider will decide later this month whether to add yuan-denominated shares to key equity benchmarks. Scandals and trading halts at Hong Kong-listed mainland firms have made passive fund managers' jobs difficult already. Bringing in onshore tickers could complicate things further.
German vote bodes ill for utilities and autos,"French voters are handing President Emmanuel Macron a flawed mandate to overhaul the economy. His party, La Republique En Marche!, pulled off a stunning coup on Sunday by topping the first round of polls little more than a year after it was founded. It looks set to win a big parliamentary majority after the second-round vote on June 18. But this is not quite the ringing endorsement of his economic reform proposals that it appears."
High yield earns stamp of approval for Japan Post,"Who takes over from Jamie Dimon has just become a mystery-horse race. The JPMorgan chief executive is losing his leading successor candidate, Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames. Granted, the bank’s division heads are all more than capable executives, but age or inexperience probably means they’d be interim CEOs at best."
Cox: Facebook's about-face is only partial victory,"In the few short months since Adam Lashinsky turned in the manuscript of his new book about Uber to editors at Portfolio/Penguin, enough has happened at the ride-hailing leviathan to fill another one. That is of course beyond the author's control, but also creates the nagging impression that life already has sped past this literary journey's destination."
Germany’s Caribbean coalition will shake Europe,"British voters are their currency’s worst enemy. An election that produced no clear winner has knocked sterling lower, nearly a year after it was pummelled by a UK vote to leave the European Union. A brutal EU exit and a second Scottish independence referendum may now be a little less likely. But that is not a good enough reason to stock up on pounds anytime soon."
Diminished Merkel will choke ambitious euro reform,Jack Ma's big data ambitions have gotten a stamp of approval from investors. Shares of Alibaba rocketed up 13 percent on Thursday - the group's biggest daily rise since going public - after the company revealed startlingly optimistic revenue growth forecasts during its annual investor conference. It's a powerful vindication of Ma's forays into AI and cloud technology.
Life could get choppy for Sea after $1 bln IPO,"Theresa May has become the latest Western politician to suffer from an anti-incumbent backlash. The Prime Minister’s Conservative government has lost its majority in Britain’s general election. Even if it clings to power, the gamble on seeking a bigger mandate has spectacularly failed."
Life could get choppy for Sea after $1 bln IPO,"Britain has voted for a government with little power to do anything of note. That may be just what the economy needs. The hung parliament that emerged from June 8’s election leaves room for a middle-ground approach to tax and spending, while some of the worst manifesto ideas on migration, Brexit and nationalising industries are likely to be consigned to the policy dustbin."
Fed balance-sheet runoff could rock fiscal boat,"James Comey’s callout of Donald Trump’s lies is likely to bog down an already struggling administration. The former FBI director said the U.S. president lied on several occasions, and he illustrated Trump’s knack for self-sabotage. The fresh hits to his credibility can only further hobble the White House’s economic agenda."
"Senate to vote on ending government shutdown, Trump wall impasse","Nordstrom insiders have chosen a good time to consider taking the business out of the public eye. A modestly leveraged buyout of the $7.6 billion U.S. clothing seller – recently most famous for dropping first daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing line – looks doable with members of the eponymous family rolling over their stakes. The growing list of retailers struggling with debt should sound a note of caution, though."
U.S. courts have funds to operate through Jan. 31: statement,"The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether President Donald Trump's former Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, lied to Department of Interior investigators in what could be a potential criminal violation, the Washington Post reported on Thursday."
Top Democrat warns acting U.S. attorney general about Russia probe,"The French state is a curious shareholder: too active in some cases, too passive in others, and largely unconcerned about underperforming the broader market. President Emmanuel Macron has the chance to rectify these problems. The question is whether he has the desire."
UniCredit has narrow lead in Commerzbank M&A fight,"The hedge-fund industry has a miserable message for Hong Kong. The latest annual Sohn Hong Kong fundraiser heard a wide range of investment pitches, but when it came to the host city, two of the three were short-selling takedowns. And many local shares sold off beforehand on fears they could be targets. That is hardly a vote of confidence in efforts to clean up the market."
Review: How Murdoch’s news revolution devoured him,"Companies don’t vote – people do. Were it the other way round, Britain’s election this Thursday would be even more difficult to call. Both the ruling Conservatives and the opposition Labour party offer businesses bad choices. On balance, capitalists may prefer the incumbent party – if only because it probably lacks the conviction to carry out many of its promises."
Nestlé’s L’Oréal stake is ready for a makeover,"Noble Group must convince its lenders to give it more time. The struggling Asian commodity trader desperately needs to extend a $2 billion credit line this month. But credit and equity investors are betting the company's debts are probably unmanageable, and a bankruptcy filing or some similarly painful fix is likely."
Review: How Murdoch’s news revolution devoured him,"David Einhorn’s financial-engineering bid has hit a dead end at General Motors. His fund Greenlight Capital’s proposal to boost the automaker’s value by issuing a new class of dividend shares got a drubbing from investors at Tuesday’s annual meeting. Chief Executive Mary Barra can’t afford to gloat, though. The company’s stock is flatlining and plenty of speedbumps lie ahead."
Diplomatic fog blinds China and U.S. over N. Korea,"The Brits are about to elect a new government that’ll take the country out of the EU. Brexit, though, has taken a back seat in the campaign to deadly attacks in London and Manchester – and growing concerns about how the new masters of Whitehall will deal with social welfare."
Viewsroom: German election all about runners-up,"British voters are sleepwalking to a painful Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May called the election scheduled for Thursday to give herself a stronger hand in negotiating the country’s departure from the European Union. But she and her main opponent, Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, have largely avoided any discussion of the trade-offs involved."
SEC failure puts U.S. cyber security on back foot,"The way out of the diplomatic trap in North Korea runs through Beijing. The People’s Republic has more to lose than the United States from the soon-to-be nuclear power on its doorstep. Regime change led by China, rather than the United States, may be the best of a range of unappealing options."
HTC tethers itself to a new virtual reality,"Britain's cyberspace crackdown faces big tests. Following Saturday's attack by extremists in London, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised new curbs on propaganda and communications, potentially affecting online services like Alphabet's YouTube and Facebook's WhatsApp. Such promises can be good politics, but to actually happen they must make technological and economic sense."
Tata Steel JV pays ThyssenKrupp four dividends,U.S. President Donald Trump’s whistle-stop visit to the Gulf has emboldened Saudi Arabia to settle an old score. The kingdom and its closest allies have cut ties with Qatar and accused the gas-rich sheikdom of supporting terrorism and sidling up to Iran. It is a dramatic escalation to a lingering feud in a region that meets a fifth of world oil supply.
South Korea wobbles walking U.S.-China high-wire,"U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffed sharp criticism from fellow Republican Mitt Romney on Wednesday, heaping scorn on the incoming senator in a sign of tensions to come in Washington even before a new Congress is officially sworn in."
U.S. Department of Agriculture to reopen all farm agency offices,"Violent attacks on civilians are designed to sow division. Troublingly, the multiple murders by militants in London’s city centre on Saturday night come at a time when Britain is already deeply fractured along economic, geographic and demographic lines. That shows why Prime Minister Theresa May’s repeated pledge to make Britain “strong and stable” ahead of Thursday’s election resonates, but also why it is so hard to deliver."
North Carolina judge refuses to certify Republican as winner of U.S. House vote,"Even global-warming sceptics can be alarmed by Donald Trump’s pledge to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. In fact, thoughtful sceptics might be best placed to worry. Since they do not see any increased environmental threat, they are able to focus on where Trump is doing the most damage: to the still fragile system of global governance."
"Top U.S. diplomat for Europe resigns, cites personal, professional reasons","In one way, a personal tragedy is making Facebook a better place. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg’s “Option B,” a moving exploration of grief, emerged from the sudden death of her husband. Top executives rarely reveal so much. She has also changed Facebook’s policies. More so than her earlier best seller, “Lean In,” Sandberg’s new book sets her up as the $450 billion social network's best ambassador."
What we’ve learned about Brexit so far,A British lawmaker once compared Mark Carney to an unreliable boyfriend due to his changing guidance about the direction of interest rates. The Bank of England governor is showing greater consistency when it comes to fighting UK inflation. Some support staff at the central bank are threatening to strike over a 1 percent pay rise. The award mirrors the economy-wide squeeze in incomes that hits the least well-off the hardest. But it would be odd for Carney to under
Foreign automakers will pay for Chinese EV drive,"Yusaku Maezawa has a tech fortune to spray around. The art-collecting entrepreneur recently paid $111 million for an untitled 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, one of the biggest sums ever spent on contemporary art. That throws a spotlight on his fashion e-tailer, Start Today, which is the means to his end."
Lure of scale drives Axa asset management union,"The president is pulling America out of the climate pact signed by 195 countries in 2015. But the continued commitment from cities, companies, investors and other states will limit the damage. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs steps into a Venezuelan mess. Plus: advertisers as activists."
Colour-coding Germany’s election,"It was 50 years ago that the Beatles started one of the greatest industrial booms of the 20th century. ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" was released in the United States on June 2, 1967, kicking off three decades of explosive growth in recorded-music sales. Though the industry has faded in and out, the LP's simple messages still resonate, even in the broader world of business. As Warren Buffett and other executives have argued, if not quite so lyrically,"
China's drugmakers boast Big Pharma option value,Akzo Nobel has laid down an important brick in the wall of fortress Europe. The maker of Dulux paint thwarted a strategically and financially attractive takeover approach by U.S. rival PPG that was vociferously backed by many of the group’s investors – and did so without putting forward a convincing defence. It’s an alarming precedent.
AI is the big driver of SoftBank’s Uber move,"China's obsession with economic growth encourages officials and bankers to wink at lending based on non-existent collateral. The problem is vast, but the system is designed to look the other way. What it's not designed to do is cope with the crisis that could ensue if asset prices fall."
Viewsroom: Ray Dalio taps his inner communist,"Donald Trump is set to withdraw from the Paris accord on climate change, news reports say. To some that's a clear abdication of U.S. leadership. There may be a silver lining, though. For the nearly 200 countries committed to the deal – including the EU and top polluter China – progress may be much smoother free of Washington foot-dragging."
Cox: Donald Trump is failing America's gun lobby,"The U.S. Navy has informed lawmakers of its intent to pursue a block purchase of two Ford-class aircraft carriers, Senator Tim Kaine's office said on Monday, a step officials have said could save billions of dollars as the Trump administration tries to expand the size of the fleet."
EU foreign investment review raises bar for China,"Exxon Mobil shareholders have finally won a long-sought climate-change victory. Over 60 percent of them backed a move that forces the $340 billion oil giant to ramp up global-warming disclosure, up from under 40 percent in a similar attempt last year. Exxon already embraces the debate more than most. But shareholders want the company to be more forthcoming. Holdout industry peers will have to follow or risk investor ire."
Saudi can afford to scrap Aramco IPO plan,"The World Economic Forum should know better. In its recent white paper on pensions, “We’ll live to 100 – how can we afford it?” the group behind the Davos uber-conference repeats the conventional wisdom on the topic: that everyone should save more. While that might be helpful advice for many reasons, no amount of current savings can reduce the burden of future pensions."
"On road to 2020, New York's Gillibrand touts liberal cred in Iowa",Britain’s credit boom is a cause for concern. Not for the obvious reasons: rates are low and the banking sector is sturdy. The issue lies with another big UK industry - cars.
Democratic Senator Kamala Harris jumps into 2020 White House race,"Samsung looks unprepared for a future without a prince firmly on the throne. The sprawling business empire, facing unprecedented legal risks, is preserving a structure that lets the Lee family keep nominal control of its $289 billion crown jewel via a small stake, despite an activist investor lobbying for an overhaul. The decision makes the group harder to steer, and the iconic South Korean brand owes much of its success to two generations of charismatic, if a"
U.S. air safety agents absences hit record level; shutdown in Day 31,"If a deal looks too good to be true, it may just be. Money managers at Goldman Sachs bought $2.8 billion face value of Petroleos de Venezuela bonds at a deep discount last week, attracting the ire of critics of President Nicolas Maduro. Investments aren’t necessarily moral choices, but they can hit reputations."
Chinese web grocer’s IPO requires a strong stomach,"British Airways’ IT systems can grind to a halt without the help of hackers. A computer mess forced the UK flag carrier to cancel hundreds of flights over a busy holiday weekend. Yet both BA and its owner, IAG, can weather the turbulence."
Chinese web grocer’s IPO requires a strong stomach,"India's Ambani brothers are never far from drama. An upstart telecom operator led by elder brother Mukesh, the country's richest man, has upended the industry. Younger brother Anil's Reliance Communications is suffering especially. The pain has some way to run."
Campaign for euro zone budget is a distraction,"Donald Trump’s looming decision about whether to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement will be, let's say, anticlimactic. It will be a surprise if the global-warming skeptic who has called the phenomenon a hoax breaks a campaign pledge by sticking with the 2015 agreement. If he pulls out, though, the actual impact on the climate and on global efforts to limit warming will be limited."
New iPhones take features from Asia and add profit,A  Labour government’s soft Brexit would still be pretty hard. The UK opposition is gaining in polls ahead of Britain’s June 8 vote. Leader Jeremy Corbyn is more pro-immigration than Tory Theresa May - but he is less pro-EU than he looks.
Goldman’s biggest asset in UK banking is lateness,A  Labour government’s soft Brexit would still be pretty hard. The UK opposition is gaining in polls ahead of Britain’s June 8 vote. Leader Jeremy Corbyn is more pro-immigration than Tory Theresa May - but he is less pro-EU than he looks.
Merkel’s past omissions will return to haunt her,"More Americans blame President Donald Trump than congressional Democrats for the partial U.S. government shutdown, according to  a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday, as the closure stretched into its sixth day with no end in sight."
China’s “insurtech” star over-stresses the tech,"Rupert Murdoch's Fox is poking a sleeping advertising bear. For the second time this year, one of the entertainment conglomerate's popular prime-time programs faces a branding boycott. Twenty-First Century Fox isn't alone, though. YouTube, the web-video site operated by Alphabet's Google, has recently been in the crosshairs, too. Madison Avenue may be slowly transforming from a passive investor to a more activist one."
Dixon: No escape from debtors’ prison for Greece,Favoring antsy venture capitalists could be asking for trouble. Cashing out these early financial backers of fledgling firms on demand can leave longer-term investors in a lurch. A case involving onetime dot-com darling Oversee.net and Oak Hill Capital suggests some judges find the practice potentially disloyal to startups and their owners. It’s an overdue warning about the damage such conflicts of interest can cause.
Beijing prepares to stand yuan policy on head,Basic economics - and decency - fall by the wayside in the administration’s pitch that it can create $2 trln of revenue by cutting $3.6 trln of costs. OPEC and U.S. fields battle for oil supremacy. Zimbabwe invents the zollar. And Bill Ford escapes his CEO’s crash unscathed.
Equifax hack provides an Exxon Valdez moment,"Germany’s new chancellor will probably be its old one. Angela Merkel is on track to win a fourth term in the country’s Sept. 24 vote. Unlike France and the Netherlands, which voted earlier this year, Germany faces no credible threat from anti-European firebrands. But the next Merkel government could come in different flavours, depending on her choice of coalition partner."

U.S. special counsel disputes report Trump told lawyer to lie,"For women striving for a seat at the top table, Asia is a depressing place. Hong Kong and Singapore lag Western peers in terms of number of females in the boardroom. Despite the known business benefits and an ample pool of talent, there has been glacial progress in promoting the gender. It is time for local authorities to ditch market forces and embrace quotas to fix the imbalance."
Review: Bank of England's present echoes in past,"For centuries, cross-border trade has come with a currency problem. The expansion of globalisation has not made it any less pressing. The dilemma identified by the economist Robert Triffin is a powerful – and alarmingly current – reminder that a worldwide foreign exchange crisis is only one big mood change away."
Insurance giants may get another chance in China,"Glencore has fought hard for a lean balance sheet. Now it has one, it can keep things simple and give more money to shareholders, or binge on an acquisition. A merger approach to U.S. agricultural trader Bunge suggests Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg favours the latter, somewhat riskier course of action. Such boldness could leave investors going hungry."
Viewsroom: Harvey’s path of financial destruction,"An Indian yogi is demonstrating the power of local consumer champions. Baba Ramdev, a saffron-robed tycoon, says his company, Patanjali Ayurved, doubled sales last year to more than $1.6 billion, making it bigger than the local arms of Colgate and GlaxoSmithKline. His multinational rivals barely grew at all over the same period, as a shock move to scrap bank notes disrupted everyday life. Patanjali's powerful pull underscores a new trend of emerging market consum"
Swedish banks unfairly left out in the cold,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria during an unannounced visit to Iraq, saying that many people will start seeing things on Syria the same way he does."
Record basketball price is timely bet on Houston,"A suicide bomber has brought a tragic twist to the British election. The attack that killed at least 22 concertgoers in the northern city of Manchester and left another 59 injured was the country’s deadliest for more than a decade. Even in a country familiar with acts of terror, this will shift the debate."
Facebook's fuzzy math blurs its TV picture,"HNA Group has alighted on a logical, if pricey, target in Hong Kong. The deal-hungry Chinese travel conglomerate known for overpaying wants to invest in Value Partners, one of Asia’s few sizeable independent asset managers, says Bloomberg. If HNA wants to connect Chinese investors with the wider world, this could be useful."
Deutsche Bank CEO tells truth to robotic employees,"Wal-Mart’s online therapy may help revive ailing retailers. The $242 billion giant is starting to reap the benefits of embracing e-commerce while shares in digital laggards like Macy’s and J.C. Penney plummeted after poor results. Unless they follow the behemoth’s lead, they’re likely to hand more market share to Wal-Mart and internet megastore Amazon."
Cheap data feeds Murdoch’s Indian cricket pitch,"Ford Motor’s many flubs under Mark Fields were becoming existential for the $43 billion carmaker’s founding family. Two weeks ago, a majority of those shareholders not named Ford voted to abolish the family's super-voting stock. The Fords took the hint, and the chief executive is now leaving. But naming a 62-year-old from the furniture trade to replace him hints at how unprepared the family was for a revolt."

China's house rental push is past due,"Can you have vision without clarity? When it comes to SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son, it seems the answer is yes. The Japanese maverick has unveiled the first close of his $100 billion technology fund, rustling up $93 billion in seven months: an unprecedented sum, raised in a very short space of time. If he can deploy that to find more gems like Alibaba , his most successful investment, this may turn into a bonanza for SoftBank investors. But for now he is keepin"

"Supreme Court silent on 'Dreamers' appeal, other big cases","Elizabeth Warren's latest book reads like a marker for a 2020 White House campaign. In ""This Fight is Our Fight,"" the U.S. senator from Massachusetts blasts familiar targets like lobbyists and Wall Street, plus a new foe: President Donald Trump. Tales of struggling Americans are engagingly woven into the outrage. Still, her rote views limit her appeal."
Trump tells anti-abortion marchers he will support them,"Asia’s aviation hub model is showing signs of wear and tear. Chinese competition is hitting both Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong rival Cathay Pacific, and neither has a big domestic customer base to rely on. At least the Singaporeans have a smarter-looking approach to budget travel."
China's house rental push is past due,What would Mike Pence do? That's the question global investors may ponder amid the woes of U.S. President Donald Trump.

China-India spat signals last hurrah for BRICS,"Theresa May has left herself some Brexit wiggle room. Unveiling the Conservative Party manifesto for Britain’s June 8 election, the prime minister made some aggressive-sounding noises on immigration and her willingness to leave the European Union without a deal. She also left herself space to negotiate a less damaging departure. Adherents of both a “hard” and a “soft” exit from the European Union will hear what they want – but only one will get it."
United Tech breathes rarefied air to bulk up,Confusing days are here again for Chinese investors. Tough talk from top regulators about financial risks accelerated the selloff in the country’s financial markets earlier in the year. But now officials are trying to prop up stocks to provide a happy backdrop for political showpieces. It’s a muddle that even China’s proposed super-regulator cannot resolve.
Bell Pottinger falls victim to PR disruption,Wall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington. The S&P 500 Index fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called Trump rally since last year's U.S. election. Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift.
Elliott shows tail wags dog in German M&A,Donald Trump’s promise to run the government like a business is proving difficult but Congress could act like strong independent directors to rein in his wayward management. China’s ambitious Silk Road project could leave its people holding the bag. Plus: job cuts at Ford.
China-India spat signals last hurrah for BRICS,"Amazon.com is a prescription for pharmacy woes. The internet retailer has set its sights on the $300 billion business of selling drugs to U.S. customers, according to CNBC. Regulation and delivery concerns are barriers. Yet these, and the inefficiency of U.S. healthcare, also promise lucrative earnings for a company happy with razor-thin margins."
China-India spat signals last hurrah for BRICS,"Britain is in the middle of a joyless job boom. Nearly three out of every four working-age people were employed in the first quarter of 2017 – the highest level since the early 1970s. But prices are rising faster than wages, and a post-Brexit crackdown on immigration threatens to limit expansion in the workforce. That makes persistently weak productivity an even greater cause for alarm."
China-India spat signals last hurrah for BRICS,"TPG Capital is getting crafty with its investment in online homemade-goods dealer Etsy. The private-equity firm run by David Bonderman and James Coulter, along with partner Dragoneer Investment Group, took an 8 percent combined stake in the $1.6 billion company in the midst of a shakeup. Buying passive equity stakes isn't TPG's core competence. So TPG's creativity is a testament to the challenges of the buyout business, where money is plentiful but asset prices a"
China-India spat signals last hurrah for BRICS,"Britain has recouped its 20.3 billion pound investment in Lloyds Banking Group. This is a victory – made more pronounced because it comes a day after a fund of Singapore’s government said it sold shares in Swiss lender UBS at a big loss. There is a big difference, though: Lloyds’ bailout bill isn’t just financial. And, despite appearances, it is nowhere near repaid in full."

Trump lawyer Giuliani denies the president told Cohen to lie,"Jeffrey Ubben has long been a different kind of activist investor.

Vivendi still looks like a one-legged stool,"To the typical UK voter, the Conservative Party is associated with sound management of the public finances. The Labour Party, meanwhile, is the go-to for progressives who don’t mind seat-of-the-pants tax and spend policies. Labour’s manifesto released on May 16 fits the pattern, but Britain’s impending exit from the European Union has muddied the waters over which party is the real risk-taker."
Congress will point way to China’s future,"Europe’s low-cost airlines owe much of their growth to taking bold strategic decisions at unusual times. In the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11 2001, they ordered hundreds of new aircraft, negotiating large discounts with manufacturers as more established rivals scaled back. A decade and a half later, easyJet and its no-frills competitors are once again being bold when others are under pressure."
Wells Fargo CEO exposed by supersized scandal,"GIC has admitted defeat on its investment in UBS. The Singapore state’s money manager is taking a loss by selling a chunk of shares in the Swiss bank that it helped rescue nearly a decade ago. It’s not the only sovereign investor that was seduced by Western bank stocks during the financial crisis. A bounce in global financial stocks could tempt others, such as peer Temasek, to sift the wheat from the chaff."
Viewsroom: Trump may unite Congress - against him,"Thermo Fisher Scientific has started a new experiment with a pricey deal. The maker of electron microscopes, DNA-sequencing machines and other lab supplies is paying about $5.2 billion to buy Patheon, which produces drugs and the chemicals used in them. Cost savings don’t come close to covering the premium being paid. While the industry may be ready for consolidation, Thermo Fisher also has a lot to learn."
Elliott’s Stada shakedown is cheeky but rational,"A customer skimps on software upgrades; a malicious program storms its computers. As far as the blame game goes, this weekend’s global malware attack seems straightforward. In reality, things are more complex."
China’s big banks dig deeper into housing market,"Theresa May is preparing to aim a loaded shotgun at her own foot. When the UK prime minister unveils the Conservative party election manifesto this week, she is likely to reiterate an objective dating back to 2010 to reduce annual net migration below 100,000. That means taking a needless risk with Britain’s economy."
United Technologies’ avionics bid looks airworthy,"Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial, China's largest dairy company, is preparing a gut-busting $850 million bid for Danone's Stonyfield yogurt business. The French food group will need to marshal all the willpower it can to resist the temptation of this rich offer. Far too many Chinese buyers of U.S. assets have left sellers in the lurch. Yili itself was thwarted by regulators on a recent deal at home. Danone has bigger interests to consider here than cash. "
Russian bailout rekindles too-big-to-fail angst,China's dealmakers edged out their U.S. counterparts in their first round of trade talks. U.S. beef producers and financial firms will get more access to Chinese markets in exchange for chicken imports and a potential opening for Chinese banks. It’s a good start but Beijing didn’t give up much.
Blackstone hunts Japanese deals – and pensions,"Pushy bosses are on the ascendant in French companies. Vivendi, Christian Dior and Safran are all embarking on complex deals driven by the lopsided interests of big shareholders and executives. In each case, minority investors can’t do much about the potential conflicts. C’est la vie, unfortunately."
Blackstone hunts Japanese deals – and pensions,"Hong Kong's stock market is better off without Beijing's support. State-backed institutions are preparing to support the bourse if needed before a likely visit by President Xi Jinping, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. This looks like fresh evidence of Beijing's tightening grip on the city - and its belief that market prices are a tool to signal good news. Exporting that stance will dent Hong Kong's appeal."

"Skadden law firm, linked to Manafort, settles U.S. case on Ukraine work","Sometime around the age of six, I remember wishing my name was Archibald, or Archie for short. I have never understood why - I didn't even like the Archie comics. With President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, I now have a theory. Archibald Cox (no relation) was the special prosecutor who stood up to Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal, which provided nightly dinner-table conversation at my home back in 1973."
Blackstone hunts Japanese deals – and pensions,"Whoever wins Britain’s general election, free markets will be the loser. Take energy: the country’s two main parties are both promising to intervene in high household electricity prices. The ruling Conservative party, which is likely to win, has hitherto been a champion of letting the forces of supply and demand work. If this goes into reverse, other countries will have less reason to move forwards."
Harvey intensifies brewing flood-insurance storm,"The number two player in Chinese gaming just advanced another level. Sales at NetEase are soaring and its shares have almost doubled in a year. It also scored a real coup by bagging the Chinese rights to ""Minecraft"", the wildly popular block-building game. Yet the $37 billion group still looks cheap next to rivals Tencent and Activision Blizzard."
British banks edge closer to painful PPI clarity,"Snap investors may be feeling nauseous.

Toshiba aims to please all with chip deal 2.0,"The clock is officially ticking for Time. Days after spurning takeover interest, the U.S. publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and other magazines slashed its dividend amid falling revenue and wider losses. Some companies have been wise to go it alone, but many struggle to recoup the deal-imputed value."
Harvey exposes flaws in U.S. energy-dominance plan,"Standard Life’s honey pot is a shrinking prize. Even as the asset manager merges with rival Aberdeen, its flagship fund, Global Absolute Return Strategies, is eroding. That makes the tie-up look less sweet for Aberdeen shareholders. Fortunately, they were already getting better than might have been expected."
These retail chains can resist the Amazon vortex,"A new levy takes some of the sheen off Australia's banks. Tuesday's budget saddled the five big players with a surprise charge based on wholesale funding. That will raise A$6.2 billion ($4.6 billion) over four years for Treasurer Scott Morrison and shows bank-bashing is good politics, even in countries that weathered the financial crisis well."
Uber’s new CEO choice will travel well,South Korea's new president will soon feel gravity's pull. Moon Jae-in’s victory in a May 9 poll heralds a softer stance on North Korea and restores domestic stability after months of chaos. But he will need to unite a polarized nation to push a much-needed reset of South Korea's growth model.
Spotify’s business model is an unfinished symphony,"Britain’s Brexit bill is worth paying. EU negotiators may ask the UK to hand over as much as 100 billion euros (84 billion pounds) as part of its orderly departure from the trading bloc. While eurosceptic politicians will complain about paying anything at all, a chaotic exit would risk imposing much greater costs on the UK’s 1.9 trillion pound economy."

Samsung guilty verdict is a victory for reformers,"Negotiators may demand the UK pay 100 bln euros as part of an orderly EU exit. Avoiding this would mean leaving without a trade deal, which would hit future growth. This Breakingviews calculator estimates how much output and tax revenue Britain stands to lose in a chaotic Brexit."
U.S. Treasury says China trade talks 'nowhere near completion',"South Korea's rule of law is on trial. Bribery charges have turned Samsung's de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, into a public enemy. A guilty verdict, if merited, could help rebuild trust in the system after an epic corruption scandal. It is equally important that he gets a fair trial, instead of being punished based on popular outrage."
Canceled Pelosi trip was to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan: spokesman,"Coach is paying luxury prices to catch up with the Europeans. The U.S. handbag maker is plunking down $2.4 billion for rival Kate Spade, a figure not justified strictly by the numbers. But Coach's owners like the $13 billion company’s move to a multibrand portfolio, which has worked for industry leaders LVMH and Kering. Mature luxury marques can no longer expect to succeed on their own."
Ex-Trump lawyer: rigging polls 'was at the direction of' Trump,Sinclair's $3.9 billion deal for Tribune Media is putting Fox in a hole. The U.S. broadcaster is paying a 26 percent premium for its rival after the Trump administration relaxed a wave of regulations. Tribune gives Sinclair more heft to mount a challenge to Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News. But it’s going to cost the buyer more than just the headline price tag.
Infosys founders get second chance on succession,"Negotiating Britain’s exit from the EU is bound to guzzle Emmanuel Macron’s time and energy once he takes over as President of France. But knitting the euro zone closer together will be the task that consumes his political capital. Punishing or pleasing the UK will be an outcome, not an objective."
Viewsroom: Fiat Chrysler’s painful choices,"A buyout bid for Fairfax Media might need an edit. On Monday, the publisher of the Australian Financial Review and the Sydney Morning Herald said it received a takeover proposal from the U.S. buyout firm TPG and a Canadian pension fund, who want to buy and break up the media house in a A$2.9 billion ($2.1 billion) deal. The headline value is decent - but a fiddly mix of cash and stock makes for difficult reading."
"Cox: No, wait, this is the real crisis anniversary","Luck as much as talent has propelled Emmanuel Macron to the French presidency. The centrist will need both in spades if he wants to be acclaimed for more than defeating National Front leader Marine Le Pen. At best the 39-year-old will push through limited reforms. At worst, he risks undermining the presidential system that underpins the country’s Fifth Republic."
Dixons double whammy is surprise that wasn’t,"Warren Buffett respects his elders. During Berkshire Hathaway's  annual shareholder bash in Omaha on Saturday, the 86-year-old Oracle sang the praises of – and delivered early 88th birthday wishes to – Jack Bogle, the Vanguard founder who pioneered low-fee index mutual funds. While the sentiment is undoubtedly genuine, it is also starting to sound a bit self-serving."
Samsonite luggage could travel more,"Daniel Loeb may be spinning his Honeywell International story a bit too far. The activist investor wants the $100 billion conglomerate to hive off its aerospace unit. That could be an option, but Loeb's pitch that it would boost shareholder value by $20 billion is a stretch."
BREAKINGVIEWS - Samsonite luggage could travel more,"The late Hyman Minsky described capitalism as an inherently unstable system. The Australian-born economist Steve Keen was a prominent follower of Minsky’s long before the global financial crisis made his unorthodox views fashionable. Thus, we can anticipate the answer to the question posed in the title of Keen’s new book, ""Can We Avoid Another Financial Crisis?"" A capitalist economy can no better avoid another financial crisis than a dog can avoid picking up flea"

"Trump antics may be virus, cure for uneasy market","The Chinese gambling enclave of Macau has been going gangbusters of late, with gambling revenue rising for a ninth straight month in April. Shares in casino firms have rallied strongly alongside. The top three Hong Kong-listed stocks, Sands China, Wynn Macau and Galaxy Entertainment, have added $20 billion in market value. But the sector still lacks a family-friendly hedge against political and economic risk. Resort operators better hope their new luck holds."
Breakingviews-WPP underestimates pinch from corporate austerity,"Lucre from apps and other services should get investors in the party mood ahead of the company’s iconic device turning 10.

"U.S. legislation steps up pressure on Huawei and ZTE, China calls it 'hysteria'","Amid a crowd of 20,000 technology enthusiasts jammed into the New Orleans convention center, Matt Rogers stands out. And not just for his sunny demeanor and colorful socks. In many ways, the co-founder of Nest Labs is an object of aspiration for the startup kids, venture capitalists and wannabe moguls attending the Collision conference in the Big Easy hoping to capitalize on the next big thing."
'Not the greatest crisis': Trump's EPA pick downplays climate threat,"Watering down oil is a terrible idea. Yet London’s stock exchange is working on creating a new category of listing to accommodate giant oil producer Saudi Aramco, Reuters reported on Thursday. In doing so it is effectively exploring the fine line between turning a profit, pleasing Saudi royals, and singeing the city’s reputation."
"China calls proposed U.S. legislation against Huawei, ZTE 'hysteria'","Apple's next iPhone will be key to its future in China. Sales in what was once the company's biggest growth market have now fallen for five straight quarters. Stiff competition with local handset makers and a weaker yuan have both hurt. While app-store sales are promising, a real turnaround hinges on the success of its much-anticipated, 10th-anniversary smartphone."
Tencent’s team has upper hand in Chinese food fight,"Facebook’s idea of slowdown is more like a steady clip. The social network reported a striking 51 percent jump in advertising revenue, to $7.9 billion, in the first quarter. Instagram’s success with users is helping the team effort. Boss Mark Zuckerberg is adding 3,000 staff to police content after a spate of violent videos. He may need more to contain reputational risk."
Breakingviews-Jeep sale would leave Marchionne nowhere to hide,"Tesla is demonstrating how its electric cars can generate valuation staying power. Chief Executive Elon Musk oversaw a loss that missed Wall Street expectations by a country mile, even as the top line clocked in ahead of forecasts. More importantly, he's vowing that annual Model 3 production alone can meet the company’s full target by the end of next year."
Murdoch’s Sky bid looks ever less rational,French savers are a good bulwark against Marine Le Pen winning the presidential election on Sunday. The far-right presidential hopeful has a strong core of supporters who back her eurosceptic manifesto. And her spendthrift economic policies may appeal to voters whose jobs and personal finances are precarious. But a vow to ditch the single currency is likely to repel undecided voters in a country with the third-highest savings rate in the euro zone.
BHP uses commodity rally to fortify position,"Apple is playing some soothing iPhone hold music. The tech colossus sold nearly 51 million smartphones despite maturing markets and a resurgent Samsung following its exploding-battery crisis. App-store sales also grew nicely, and more dividends and buybacks are on the way. That should pacify investors until Apple rolls out the 10th anniversary edition of its pioneering device."

Holding: The law rides shotgun on Uber obfuscation,"ConocoPhillips is stuck in a rut. Only asset sales kept the company’s earnings out of the red in the first three months of the year. The cash from such deals will help Conoco cut its high debt load, but Chief Executive Ryan Lance is still pushing ahead with buybacks and has started increasing the dividend rather than boosting investing. Such methods to buoy the stock have a limited lifespan."
O2 – and Britain – are losers in 5G spectrum fight,"U.S. air-traffic control badly needs first-class treatment. Donald Trump's administration wants to privatize the organization that coordinates flights and manages often antiquated systems. The Federal Aviation Administration, currently in charge, has faced obstacles in trying to upgrade its 1940s-era technology, a project estimated to cost about $35 billion. Canada pioneered a self-funding, stakeholder-governed model. A similar approach could work for "

Economic nationalists still linger in White House,"Bank chiefs are only human, but it might be better for investors if they didn’t act it. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, vouched for his brother-in-law in a spat with buyout group KKR – one of the British bank’s clients. Though Staley’s intervention is understandable, it’s also the second time he has blurred what ought to be a clear line between life and work."
Merkel matters less than her next coalition allies,"BP has almost recovered from its near-death experience in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil giant’s earnings almost tripled in the first quarter, helped by favourable oil prices and higher output. Even its hefty debt pile looks manageable provided it keeps production flowing. After seven years of pain, deliverance may be within reach."
"As shutdown lingers, Pelosi pushes Trump to delay State of Union speech","A new TV deal is stirring some bad memories of the Murdoch entertainment empire. Just a few months ago, Twenty-First Century Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch denied any interest in buying more U.S. TV stations and told investors to “rest easy” about the idea. Now it’s looking at a possible deal for $6 billion Tribune Media in partnership with private-equity firm Blackstone."
U.S. Representative Ocasio-Cortez says to serve on financial services panel,"""The Circle,"" a movie adaptation of Dave Eggers' eponymous 2013 novel, tries to chill and amuse while telling the tale of a cultish internet company that wants to save the world by abolishing privacy. The result is neither hellish enough to be a dystopian drama nor biting enough to work as satirical comedy. Like its protagonist, it means well, but lacks a sense of identity."
Schumer: Trump's State of Union speech should be delayed if government shut,"Some three decades after KKR's Henry Kravis was called a barbarian, he has encountered one at his own gate. Jeff Ubben, whose ValueAct just disclosed an interest in the buyout shop, is usually friendlier in his approach with the companies in which he invests than the term might suggest. Even so, there's a chance things could get testy."
Founders’ coup leaves a void at Infosys,The UK’s pension pickle is a key credibility test for Theresa May. The UK prime minister is dithering over whether to keep guaranteeing above-inflation increases to pensioners. She shouldn’t.
Gary Cohn faces worst career investment dilemma,"When it comes to being a bank chief executive, the received wisdom is that UBS boss Sergio Ermotti has a stronger hand than Jes Staley at Barclays. Even ignoring the UK bank chief executive’s recent disregard for whistleblowing rules, investors prefer his Swiss counterpart’s strategy of running a focused investment bank alongside a big wealth management business. That is reflected in valuations: UBS trades at 1.3 times tangible book value, almost twice Barclays’ "
Britain tries Trojan Horse trade tactic in Ireland,"The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved funds for several federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to keep them operating through Feb. 8 without the $5 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that President Donald Trump had demanded."
China takes misplaced pride in stock meddling,MSCI may get lucky in China this time around. The U.S. index provider has slashed the number of mainland tickers it wants added to equity benchmarks tracked by $1.6 trillion in assets. This face-saving compromise is likely to overcome asset managers’ reluctance to include onshore Chinese stocks after three previous failed attempts. But the new approach is so conservative that the resulting funds flows into China will resemble a rounding error.
"Like much else, Amazon can sell debt in a flash","France is about to choose a new president. The UK has called a surprise election. Germans head to the polls soon and Italians and Greeks could be close behind. As Brexit gets in motion and President Trump settles in, Europe’s election season will bring risks and opportunities."
Washington has infrastructure backwards,"The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency are shaping up as either a bust or huge. That's how politics rolls: success or failure is in the eye of the beholder. The stock market offers a bit more precision. One message from the 65-odd trading days since Trump took office decrying ""American carnage"" is that perceived proximity to the Oval Office is no blessing for companies' stock prices."
British wage mystery has non-British explanation,"Lloyds Banking Group has hit peak Antonio Horta-Osorio. The UK lender’s recovery under its current chief executive has been impressive, however one slices it.

Take the money and run is new Uber Benchmark,"Twitter has undeservedly attracted a bunch of new followers. The struggling social-media company touted surprise user growth as evidence it can get back on track under moonlighting Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Revenue, however, fell 8 percent in the first quarter, a first since Twitter went public in 2013, as advertisers grew skeptical."

Hoyer was wrong when he said Trump address was off: statement,"Tidjane Thiam’s plan to raise new capital isn’t the Credit Suisse boss’s first U-turn. Compared with other big reversals – like his decision in 2016 to dump securitised products and leave investors nursing big losses – this is, at least, the good kind."
"Trump threatens to use emergency power to build wall, end shutdown","It's time to add Wells Fargo's chairman to the list of fake-accounts firings. Just 56 percent of shareholders backed Stephen Sanger at the bank's annual meeting on Tuesday. That’s a stinging rebuke for his failure as lead director. After 5,300 employees and the Chief Executive John Stumpf paid with their jobs, Sanger and other board members with lackluster support should go, too, to help the bank rehabilitate."
Trump cancels planned Davos trip as shutdown drags on,"Tidjane Thiam’s plan to raise new capital isn’t the Credit Suisse boss’s first U-turn.

Marchionne's Maserati spinoff lacks traction,"Toshiba's move to switch accountants reflects a desperation to avoid delisting. The crisis-stricken Japanese group may ditch the Big Four auditor it hired only last year, Reuters reported on Wednesday, which might force the firm to risk using a second-tier player. That is an ugly look for a firm that badly needs to win back the trust of regulators and investors."
"Politics aside, Chinese bid for FCA has some merit","Tyson Foods has found a delectable new bite to swallow in its quest to become America’s premier protein provider from the farmyard to the kitchen table. Its $3.2 billion purchase of ready-to-eat sandwich maker AdvancePierre takes the Springdale, Arkansas-based poultry company further up the food value chain. Along with plans to carve off some less wholesome morsels, Tyson is giving investors plenty to cluck about."
U.S. CEOs can afford principled stand against Trump,Donald Trump has found a trade battle that’s actually worth fighting. The U.S. president is slapping an average 20 percent duty on Canadian softwood lumber after decades of officials complaining of subsidies. The U.S. government has a good case for going after one of the nation’s closest allies.
"Breakdown: Killing Libor is a long, messy business","Theresa May is shaping up to be like Margaret Thatcher, but in reverse. In the 1980s, Britain’s first female prime minister launched a swathe of market-friendly reforms which increased the country’s appeal for inward investment but made her unpopular with sections of the population. News that May’s Conservative Party will pledge to cap fuel prices in its forthcoming election manifesto suggests a fundamentally different set of priorities."
Japan’s growth spurt points to household revival,"China's trust industry could use a little sunlight. The first stock market listing in 20 years is up in the air, after Shandong International Trust missed a regulatory deadline in Hong Kong. This is a pity. The initial public offering would have helped investors and regulators decipher the high-yielding trust products at the core of China’s intricate shadow-banking industry."
Union throws wrench in self-driving works,"Obamacare lives on. Republican U.S. lawmakers haven't yet repealed the Affordable Care Act, as it's formally known. Healthcare companies have to live with it, too. Becton Dickinson's $24 billion deal to buy C.R. Bard is one result. The expected cost savings fall well short of justifying the 25 percent premium. But scale brings needed negotiating power selling needles and catheters to hospitals."
UK shows consumers the value of their data,European investors have cast their vote for Emmanuel Macron. Relief that the pro-European centrist has reached the second round of France’s presidential election triggered a region-wide rally in asset prices on Monday. Yet lingering political threats to the single currency will prevent a return to business as usual.
India's war on cash had valuable benefits,"Taiwan faces a bigger threat than Chinese invasion: its own economic mismanagement. President Tsai Ing-wen has outlined plans to bolster growth, including a $29 billion stimulus package, but bolder reforms favoured by the business community look hobbled by politics. The irony is that a politician whose party is defined by resistance to Beijing may leave Taiwan more dependent on the mainland than ever."
Snap's fade could make future IPOs vanish,Investors are wary of a new blot on Japan Inc's image. Camera and photocopier-maker Fujifilm said on Thursday it had uncovered some dodgy accounting abroad. The negative stock market reaction to a $200 million flub is telling.
Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general says he will not 'be bullied' by anybody,"The choice facing French voters has become clear after the first round of the country’s presidential elections on Sunday. The pro-European reformer Emmanuel Macron will face the far-right protectionist Marine Le Pen in a runoff on May 7, projections showed. The independent centrist Macron is the clear favourite – a relief for investors who feared the rise of anti-EU candidates. His chances of victory are, however, better than his ability to deliver on promises of"
"U.S. calling back 1,700 aviation safety inspectors","U.S. President Donald Trump told his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan that Washington ""would take a look at"" the possibility of extraditing a U.S.-based Muslim cleric who Ankara suspects of being behind a 2016 coup attempt, but he made no commitment, the White House said on Tuesday."
Factbox: Impact on U.S. government widens on 25th day of shutdown,"Two top bankers can’t agree on whether lenders are too big to fail. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon reckons the problem is solved. Fed banker Neel Kashkari disagrees, because using debt to absorb losses is flawed. Markets suggest Dimon is closer to the mark."
Viewsroom: Diplomatically challenged Trump,"Donald Trump is delivering another mixed message to Wall Street. The White House will order Treasury Department reviews of rules that discourage so-called inversion deals and set out how to resolve a crisis-related financial failure. The directives themselves are innocuous for now, but the cues might encourage lax enforcement and fresh changes to the liquidation framework."
SoftBank’s Indian shopping spree gets even spicier,"U.S. President Donald Trump is embarking on an endeavor that has eluded many of his predecessors: tax reform. The last successful overhaul occurred 31 years ago under Ronald Reagan – a president Trump says he hopes to emulate. The drama was captured in the book “Showdown at Gucci Gulch,” first published in 1987. The lobbying and partisan battles depicted then seem almost quaint now, but the saga still offers useful tips on legislative pitfalls, political mane"
Charter bid would be a deal too far even for Drahi,"Technology-focused private-equity investors are planning on setting some records. Silver Lake just raised a $15 billion fund. Other buyout firms have newly stocked war chests, and Japan's SoftBank has launched a fund that could get as big as $100 billion. Silver Lake and many rivals know their patch. But there are only so many SoFis – one of the firm's holdings – and even fewer Dells. Investment discipline could be tested."
Wall Street's resolve overcomes even Pyongyang,"Being number one doesn't just matter for individuals. It has profound importance for industries, too. Before the financial crisis, investment banking was the clear career of choice for MBA graduates enticed by the prospect of money, power and prestige. Now they’re more likely to start out for Silicon Valley. Banking has lost its alpha-ness."
Netflix losing Disney sounds like an HBO sequel,"The UK PM wants an early general election to strengthen her majority in parliament, stoking market hopes of a friendly exit from the EU. Those may be misplaced. Elsewhere, Trump’s Buy American, Hire American plan is deeply flawed. And Goldman takes a beating from Morgan Stanley."
Worldpay wrings ample concessions from Vantiv sale,"Antony Burgmans seems to have a different view of hostile takeovers now that he is defending against one. As supervisory chairman of Akzo Nobel, one of the jewels in the Netherlands' industrial crown, Burgmans is trying to stonewall an unsolicited $24 billion bid from PPG Industries, not to mention calls for his head. Akzo has refused to even discuss the offer, which its U.S. rival already has increased once."
McDonald’s boldly supersizes its China strategy,Verizon's M&A signal is starting to come in a little clearer. The U.S. telecommunications titan reported a 20 percent drop in quarterly profit as a new sales initiative failed to attract customers. Its strategy behind buying AOL and Yahoo is perplexing. All of it probably helps explain why Chief Executive Lowell McAdam just indicated he's open to the idea of a bigger deal.
Strong yuan opens window to rethink forex controls,"It takes the exit of dozens of advertisers and numerous protests to force change at Twenty-First Century Fox, it seems. The company on Wednesday parted ways with top Fox News anchor Bill O’Reilly in the wake of the criticism and lost ad dollars that followed a New York Times report cataloging sexual-harassment allegations he and Fox had settled. The U.S. cable channel’s chief architect, Roger Ailes, was booted amid a similar scandal nine months ago. The cleanup"
Exchange Podcast: Art Laffer,"French politics keeps throwing up new terrors for investors. They were already perturbed by the strong showing for Marine Le Pen in the upcoming presidential election. A late surge in support for Jean-Luc Melenchon has raised the prospect that the contest may force voters to choose between candidates from the far right and the hard left. Though that scenario remains unlikely, proponents of economic heresy could still end up with more than two-fifths of the vote i"
Political crisis can turbo-boost overdue VW reform,U.S. legislation funding $867 billion in food and agriculture programs scheduled to be signed by U.S. President Donald Trump this week includes Department of Agriculture funds to help American farmers promote their products in Communist-run Cuba.
U.S. Senate advances measure to block Trump administration from easing Russia sanctions,China has upped the ante in the race for influence over Saudi Aramco's flotation. It has assembled a state consortium to act as cornerstone investors as it pushes for a Hong Kong listing. Rival exchanges in Tokyo and Singapore will need to step up to stay in the game.
"Asylum seekers should wait outside U.S., AG nominee tells Senate panel","James Gorman is rubbing Goldman Sachs’ nose in it. Morgan Stanley’s chief executive didn’t just hit his return target with a $1.8 billion first-quarter earnings showing. His fixed-income, currency and commodities traders virtually doubled their top line from what was a tough period for the industry last year, confirming that their chief rival made a mess of the first three months of the year."
U.S. acting attorney general to testify before House panel on February 8,"IBM's cloud provides little silver lining. Big Blue fell short of investor expectations and reported its 20th consecutive quarter of falling revenue. Boss Ginni Rometty keeps talking up artificial intelligence and remote servers and services. Competition, however, may prove too formidable."
Cox: Japanese beer could use some home-brew,"Theresa May’s plan to call an early election has raised investors’ hopes that Britain can avoid a damaging European Union exit. However, the assumptions which underpin their optimism will be tested during a campaign that will shed more light on the prime minister’s priorities."
Musk fine-tunes Tesla with junk-fueled turbo boost,"Tatts could wring more out of its financial suitors. On Wednesday, a KKR-backed consortium made a fresh attempt to gatecrash the Australian betting group's takeover by rival Tabcorp. At A$6.2 billion ($4.7 billion), the interloper's new proposal broadly matches Tabcorp's bid in value, but is not yet a knockout. The target's directors could open up the books and push for a little extra."
Chinese are buying London’s skyline past its peak,"Goldman Sachs' internal technology revolution cannot come soon enough. The $90 billion Wall Street firm's young online retail-banking unit is growing and could, once big enough, crank out far higher returns than the investment bank. Goldman could do with some of that extra juice already."
Signals are good for China Tower IPO,Theresa May is cashing in at the peak of her political valuation. Calling a general election for June 8 is the prime minister’s best chance of securing a strong personal mandate to lead Britain.
Neymar buyout is new peak for fantasy soccer M&A,"Netflix's content crown is starting to fit a bit more comfortably. In its first quarter, the video-streaming service led by Reed Hastings missed subscriber estimates yet still managed to grab nearly 100 million customers worldwide. The plan to spend billions on films and TV series like “Stranger Things” is helping to lift its base. But it’s still far from able to justify a stock trading at 130 times this year’s estimated earnings."
Robust retail bank helps RBS profit from atonement,Online retailers are looking more like their passé predecessors. Websites including Amazon and furniture seller Made.com are opening physical showrooms so punters can look before they buy online. Being footloose remains better than having old retail’s cost base. But new entrants wouldn’t be hiking their own expenses unless they had to.
Sydney meets Shandong in $2.5 bln share sale,"China's hottest news source has secured a sci-fi valuation. A recent fundraising values ByteDance, the group behind a popular news-feed app, at about $11 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. That the company has raised so much in a tricky sector suggests buzzwords such as artificial intelligence and big data can act like clickbait for investors."
Viewsroom: Venezuela's downward spiral,"President Donald Trump did not commit during a meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at the G20 summit two weeks ago to extradite a Muslim cleric based in the United States, a senior White House official said on Monday."
UK CEO pay cut exposes compensation guesswork,A grisly murder video has muddied Facebook’s pledge to clean up the social network. Mark Zuckerberg’s firm bungled its response to the posting of a man's killing. The incident jars with the company's promise to police fake news and other objectionable posts. Silicon Valley’s content problem will need to be addressed by more than algorithms.
UK CEO pay cut exposes compensation guesswork,Arconic's board can at least thank Klaus Kleinfeld for a brief reprieve. The chairman and chief executive of the Alcoa spinoff which makes specialty parts for cars and airplanes was shown the door for inappropriately contacting an activist shareholder. That saves Arconic's directors from having to fire him. But they will still have to answer for why they didn't do that long ago.
Hundreds of FDA staff return to work amid shutdown: Commissioner,"Taking three days to offer a basic apology to the passenger dragged off a flight suggests deeper problems at the U.S. airline. Poor leadership and processes took a toll on Wells Fargo and Toshiba, too. Executives and boards ignore the lessons of cultural failures at their peril."
"Government shutdown breaks record, with no end in sight","The code names bankers and companies attach to their mergers and acquisitions can reveal much about their own hubris. Last year, according to a study by data company IntraLinks, the most popular secret deal names included Project Diamond and Project Falcon – even though most mergers fall short of their potential. Breakingviews has taken some actual code names from the past year, and applied them to deals that seem particularly fitting."
Pentagon extends mission to Mexico border through September,"U.S. mega-banks are all dressed up with few places to grow. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo kicked off the year with results that exceeded expectations. Some of the investor exuberance over possible tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks has abated, however. Loan growth is slowing and credit costs may soon rise. Valuations have further to fall."
U.S.-China spat casts doubt on MoneyGram payoff,"A potential swoop on part of Swedish tissue and forestry products manufacturer SCA would be nothing for investors to cry about. A group of buyout firms has bid 200 billion Swedish crowns ($22.3 billion) for the company’s hygiene arm, Essity, which pulps Scandinavian trees into products ranging from baby diapers to bandages, newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported on Wednesday. Even if an offer proves soggy, it’s an example of how a breakup can open up new options for s"
Sprint: Choose from the following M&A options,"Infosys' cash return is a useful distraction from bigger questions. Boss Vishal Sikka is following his rivals at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies in returning up to $2 billion of its unused war chest. The payout will help lift some of the gloom around the Indian IT firm, which has been beset by worries about slowing growth and top-level disagreements."
Trading pains handicap fitter European banks,"Anyone wondering about the curious predicaments of Jeffrey Lacker and Paul Tucker might want to cast a glance at a 1906 comment in Banker’s Magazine, a British trade journal: “The money market is controlled by the joint-stock banks and the Bank of England is compelled to seek their active cooperation in order to protect its stock of gold.” The terms are dated, but the compulsion problem is current. Central banks are too weak to do their job well."
Search engine IPO depends on Tencent for results,"When the world's most powerful chief executive is renowned for never apologizing, it takes a special form of incompetence to be upstaged in the contrition department by Donald Trump's White House. Somehow, against extraordinary odds, United Continental Holdings – a U.S. airline reliant on customer loyalty – managed this dunderheaded achievement."
Discovery’s cable deal rests on rosy assumptions,Tesco’s customer-first strategy will chafe investors. Britain’s biggest grocer by market share reported its first full year of like-for-like sales growth in its core market in seven years on Wednesday. Boss Dave Lewis hopes to shield shoppers from rising prices and avoid crushing suppliers. The risk is that he has to fund that plan with the spoils of Tesco’s 3.7 billion pound ($4.6 billion) purchase of wholesaler Booker.
China's trophy case could become discount rack,"The U.S. Senate will publish a report this week detailing the vast scope of Russia's disinformation campaign surrounding the 2016 U.S. election campaign, the Washington Post reported on Sunday."
Cox: Snap's IPO may benefit investors after all,"Reliance Industries' rise challenges assumptions about what investors want from India's corporate giants. After four years, Mukesh Ambani's $70 billion flagship firm is on the verge of reclaiming its mantle as the country's most valuable company from IT giant Tata Consultancy Services. India’s richest man is reaping the rewards of massive risk taking."
China's trophy case could become discount rack,"The most insightful work about President Donald Trump now showing doesn't mention him by name. That's because “Sweat,” Broadway's newest hit play, first opened in 2015. As pundits were earnestly profiling presidential hopefuls such as Marco Rubio, Lynn Nottage's steel-town drama offered a nuanced look at the economic and racial resentment stirred up by the loss of American manufacturing. The critics have signed on: ""Sweat"" has just won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize f"
U.S. sanctions on Venezuela a double-edged sword,"Tesla’s shareholders have driven off into la-la land. By the close on Monday they charged up the company’s market value to $51 billion, taking it just ahead of General Motors to become America’s largest automaker. That implies investors think Chief Executive Elon Musk will outdo even some of his biggest cheerleaders’ expectations."
HSBC’s new chairman inherits a bank on the up,"If Americans know anything at all about Grover Cleveland, it is the fact that he’s the only person to have served two non-consecutive terms as U.S. president. The reason why the New York politician managed an unsurpassed round-trip to the Oval Office is what matters today: free trade."
Trump AG nominee Barr says Mueller would not back witch hunt,"Libor-fiddling has momentarily recaptured its 2012 glory days. A leaked recording has re-opened the question of how much the UK regulator knew about action by Barclays and other banks to submit lowball interbank rates in 2008 – and what the penalty should be if the answer is “a lot”. In a way, though, it’s a redundant question. Libor has hit bank bosses – just not the right ones."
AG nominee Barr pledges to support federal whistleblower law,"Life Down Under brings its own risks. Australia is enjoying its 26th recession-free year, showing how this flexible economy has made the most of a rising China. Yet an overheating housing market threatens to bring the good times to an abrupt end. "
Spike Lee joins The Killers for protest video over Trump's planned wall,United Continental has an image problem – but investors don’t seem to care. An innocent passenger on the airline’s flight from Chicago to Louisville on Sunday was forcibly removed by airport security after staff realized they didn’t have enough seats for their own off-duty cabin crew and pilots. A fellow passenger’s video of the incident quickly went viral. It’s United’s second PR flub within a month – yet the stock closed up almost 1 percent on Monday in a flat 
Apple sets course for China policy minefield,"Elliott Advisors’ plan to unlock more value from BHP Billiton has some merits. Tidying up and then breaking up could make shareholders in the Anglo-Australian miner roughly 50 percent better off, the activist investor argues. Elliott isn’t saying anything BHP hadn’t already considered, and a full split looks a stretch – but it may prompt a helpful spring clean."
Barclays gets scant credit for new trimmer figure,Jes Staley has put his foot in it. Barclays' chief executive will get a pay cut after he tried twice last year to unmask a letter-writing whistleblower who impugned the character of a recent recruit at the bank. The error may seem morally defensible: Staley wanted to defend a colleague from what he saw as unfounded smears. But it doesn’t say good things about Barclays' internal processes.
Baidu rebound buys time for reinvention,"Indonesia's tax amnesty could have been a real nightmare for the world's top private banks. Instead, the scheme, which resulted in the disclosure of $365 billion in assets, has turned out to be a blessing in disguise resulting in limited actual outflows to Indonesia and providing a chance to wash away undesirable customers."
Amazon rides open road with few bumps,California is determined to force 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls to make some hard choices.
Viewsroom: Citi lays out path to mediocrity,"Spotify could be marching to the beat of its own IPO drummer. The $8.5 billion music-streaming service is considering listing its shares directly without raising any new capital, the Wall Street Journal has reported. It would be a departure from convention that doesn't occur often for a reason."
Cox: Colombia's peace dividend won't come easy,"Crude oil prices spiked after U.S. missiles rained down on Syria. The fear isn't that military intervention could disrupt supplies but that Iran, which has been boosting output, will retaliate. Even if that scenario unfolds, though, the market's response looks excessive."
Lloyds is a good bank in a bad place,"Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting is defying gravity. A stalled $2 billion deal would add to a growing list of setbacks at LeEco, his empire that sprawls from video-streaming to smartphones and electric cars. But shares of Jia's flagship listed unit still trade at a huge premium to established giants like Alibaba and Tencent. The gulf between hype and reality is widening."
Shell gets everything right except producing oil,"It's somehow fitting that an idea with growing bipartisan support in Washington probably isn't going anywhere. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president advising Donald Trump on economic matters, now finds himself on the same team as Wall Street scourge Elizabeth Warren on the subject of breaking up banks. Congress, however, is otherwise occupied."
U.S. crackdown on Hong Kong auditors lacks force,The JPMorgan CEO’s latest shareholder letter hands President Trump and Republicans plenty of tips and sound bites for rolling back post-crisis rules. But the administration’s failure to replace the Fed’s departing top regulator throws more doubt on a Dodd-Frank overhaul.
Facebook quest beyond ads should top itinerary,"It's going to take a lot of tape and scissors to piece together a leveraged buyout of Staples that works. The office-supplies chain is in talks with private-equity shops about a possible deal. According to Breakingviews calculations, however, the investment proposition looks shaky."
U.S. lawmaker launches investigation into pharma drug pricing,"Unilever may be readying itself for some political maneuvers. The Ben & Jerry’s ice cream owner unveiled a range of measures on Thursday to increase shareholder value and prevent a re-run of Kraft Heinz’s $143 billion hostile takeover approach, which the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant rebuffed in February. The revamp is mostly obvious stuff. But plans to review Unilever’s dual Anglo-Dutch structure offer a cunning way to build a political shield."
Senate to take up Russia sanctions measure Tuesday,"Fantasy gaming shares offer some real-life charms. Netmarble wants a fantastical-sounding valuation in one of South Korea's biggest-ever initial public offerings. But the maker of online role-playing games is growing fast, and profitability is soaring. So this could entrance investors - provided they believe the hits will keep coming."
New Illinois governor promises balanced budget for state,"Consolidation is fueling inflation in the U.S. fast-food market. JAB, the privately held owner of Krispy Kreme, Peet’s Coffee and other assets, is paying $7.5 billion including debt for Panera Bread. That’s a stratospheric 41 times projected earnings for 2017. The buyer has deep pockets and no pesky shareholders to answer to, and its target boasts one of the industry’s strongest growth rates. But such a lofty valuation will have few rivals in the M&A oven."
SEC brings dodgy digital-currency sales to earth,Markets are snoozing their way to a Marine Le Pen showdown. French government bond prices suggest a lower probability than the bookies do that the National Front leader will win the imminent presidential election. The big challenges to investors’ sangfroid would be voter apathy or a left-wing alliance – both the kinds of thing that defy traditional market analysis.
EU play for primary dealers may speed their demise,"The United States plans to counter the rapidly expanding Chinese and Russian economic and political influence in Africa, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Thursday, calling business practices of the two nations ""corrupt"" and ""predatory."""
ITV takeover is increasingly plausible plot twist,"China's next megacity has some merits. The central government will construct an auxiliary capital city out in the sticks, 100 km south of Beijing. Plans to build the Xiongan New Area in a rural corner of Hebei province have fanned speculation in property and stocks, and led state media to make excited comparisons with the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, a reform pilot which drove economic reform in the 1980s. As a mammoth construction project rather than an ex"
CKI’s push into energy-metering looks smart,"Fox News has entered the spin zone. Automakers Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and BMW are among the companies pulling ads from ""The O'Reilly Factor"" amid a scandal involving popular host Bill O'Reilly. The cost to parent Twenty-First Century Fox is low for now. A toxic culture, however, can damage long-run efforts to broaden consumer appeal."
Exchange Podcast: Duff McDonald,"It’s hard to fault Iceland’s sense of humour. The North Atlantic state’s finance minister chose April Fools’ Day to mull the idea of pegging the domestic currency, the crown, to the euro – reviving a short-lived policy from 2008. The theory is this could help reduce volatility. It didn’t work very well then, and wouldn’t help much now either."
Jimmy Choo buyout could blister the brand,"Despite an eleventh-hour wrangle over pensions last week, Greece’s creditors are soon likely to approve the latest payment due under its current 86 billion euro bailout programme. But this will only buy Athens time until mid-2018. After that, a new programme – the country’s fourth since the start of its financial crisis – will probably be required."
HNA shines dim light on ownership,"Credit Suisse knows the importance of keeping its nose clean. The Swiss bank confirmed on March 31 that its offices had been raided by authorities in several countries in relation to possible tax evasion. It later stressed its ""strict zero tolerance policy"", pointing to a review initiated in 2011 to purge it of any dicey clients. A guilty plea and $2.6 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over tax evasion in 2014 have given the bank good reason to be scrupulo"
Fintech faithful put payments on a pedestal,HNA Group's empire-building puts it on a risky trajectory. The Chinese travel outfit has spent tens of billions of dollars abroad on everything from land and hotels to high finance. These are just opening gambits as HNA seeks to amass trillions of dollars in assets.
Alphabet opacity hinders Google's antitrust fight,"U.S. states need to boost their credibility with the European Union. With deregulation in the air in Washington, insurers American International Group and Prudential Financial could lose their designations as systemically important financial institutions – along with MetLife. That would end Federal Reserve monitoring and throw oversight back on individual states. But the three companies are also global SIFIs in the eyes of regulators in the EU and elsewhere. "
WebMD gets second opinion on rollup strategy,"Pravin Gordhan’s exit is a double blow to investors in South Africa. The ousted finance minister had a plan to tackle the overall size of the country’s debt pile, and control its cost of borrowing. Following his sacking late on Thursday by President Jacob Zuma, those reassurances for providers of capital have been ripped away."
Schumer to force vote on U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Russia firms,"David Goodhart has done something remarkable: he has written a book about British society that does not revolve around the concept of class. “The Road to Somewhere” argues that the decision to leave the European Union has exposed the division between cosmopolitan elites and those left behind by rapid change. Though the tension is real, the distinction serves as a faulty compass for policy."
House Democrats eye reported FBI probe of Trump,"India needs to convince the country’s poor that bailing out banks is in their interests. That is the top challenge facing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government as it seeks to clean up state-owned lenders. Meanwhile, banks are scared of being accused of selling bad assets too cheaply. Any comprehensive plan will have to overcome both hurdles."
Texas tent city that holds migrant teens to close,The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday introduced legislation holding Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and insisting on accountability.
"Carmakers need more collaboration, not less","Peter Cohen has been angling for an investment banking comeback since he merged his Ramius alternatives investment shop with brokerage Cowen Group eight years ago. He’s built on the firm’s core healthcare franchise, but a slump in initial public offerings threatens his ambitions. Now the former Shearson chief executive, whose role in putting RJR Nabisco in play was chronicled in ""Barbarians at the Gate"", believes he’s found a solution: Chinese cash and connecti"
Abe's weakness puts Japan reform momentum at risk,"The activist’s proposal that the automaker split its stock to give some shareholders a perpetual dividend is a risky maneuver. President Trump’s plan for skilled-worker visas may make Canada great again. Plus, Republicans face high hurdles to overhaul the U.S. tax code."
Puppy love keeps IPO investors on the leash,"Little is more satisfying than cracking open a vintage Sears, Roebuck & Co catalog and marveling at the breadth of its offerings, dated illustrations and all. The one for the spring and summer of 1971, for instance, runs to 1,071 pages and offers everything from Dacron polyester nurse uniforms to colonial birch-veneer bedroom sets. Sadly, this once-great American retailer of everything may not make it to its 130th birthday in one piece."
Buyout firms bet $3.7 bln on fintech’s dicier side,"Lloyd’s sums up London’s phantom exodus. A day after the UK formally announced the start of its two-year process to exit the European Union, its best-known insurance marketplace confirmed plans to open a new office in Brussels. The outflow of staff – in the mere tens, out of a UK workforce approaching 900 – is consistent with a sense that “Brexodus” is a steady trickle rather than a torrent."
Euro rally will only speed its own reversal,"South Korea has a chance to reset. Its president has been ousted in a corruption scandal that is also threatening to bring down the nation's top business leader. The political crisis lays bare the fundamental problems of an economy built around a few conglomerates, and sets the scene for real reform."
Blackstone’s Asia move shows Eastern promise,"Divorce can be messy even, when both sides start out wanting an amicable settlement. Brexit may well work the same way now that Prime Minister Theresa May has triggered the process for Britain to leave the European Union. For now, investors are more hopeful than they were six months ago that the UK can quit the bloc without ravaging its economy, a Breakingviews index based on asset prices shows (http://tmsnrt.rs/2nEUUgf)."
Uber could one day end up like Yahoo,"Tencent is drifting off course with Tesla. The $276 billion tech behemoth can easily afford a $1.8 billion stake in the Palo Alto-based group, run by entrepreneur Elon Musk. But Musk's electric cars are not a great fit with the Chinese group's cash-cow businesses, social media and mobile games. Making a huge, venture capital-style bet like this is a worrying sign of indiscipline."
"Viewsroom: Why U.S. tax reform is doomed, too",Saudi Arabia has hit on a cheap way to spruce up the odds for its big oil producer’s initial public offering: cut its taxes. The move should deliver a sizeable uplift on Aramco’s value as it prepares to sell around 5 percent of the state-owned company to outside investors in an IPO. But it need not be a big drain on Saudi’s finances.
Central banks have no choice but to keep the faith,"Investors, regulators, customers – everyone wants a piece of Tesco. The UK supermarket chain has come under fire from two big shareholders over what they see as a distracting, expensive takeover of wholesaler Booker Group. A financial regulator has used Tesco to experiment with compensating victims of market abuse. And customers just want ever-lower prices, as always. This last challenge is the one that could really knock things off course."
Unilever is half way there on Kraft challenge,The ever-closer relationship between Chinese companies and banks can be a toxic mix. A growing number of companies in the People's Republic are buying into local lenders that need to raise capital. The interdependence is risky.
Air traffic controllers' union sues over unpaid work during government shutdown,"Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Wednesday warned the United States not to politicize extradition cases, a day after President Donald Trump said he could intervene in the affair of a Chinese executive detained in Canada at Washington's request."
U.S. ambassadors fly to Washington conference despite shutdown,"German voters are increasingly tired of Angela Merkel, who has been chancellor for 12 years. Yet a small state election on Sunday suggests she has good odds of winning a fourth term in the country’s federal election in September. Her government would be more stable and predictable than charismatic and radical alternatives on the left. For now that’s enough to persuade the electorate."
Factbox: Impact on U.S. government widens on 21st day of shutdown,"Hong Kong has its first female political leader in Carrie Lam, elected on Sunday by a 1,194-strong committee of mostly pro-Beijing loyalists. The career bureaucrat charmed local elites, but is otherwise unpopular. As growth slows and a wealth gap widens, Lam's plans to loosen the city’s purse strings might buy a few hearts. But the real test will be buttressing the rule of law. Pushing back against the forces that got her elected appears mission impossible."
EasyJet can afford a spell on autopilot,Tidjane Thiam's compensation for 2016 shows up Credit Suisse's tin ear. The Swiss bank's board has granted its chief executive 11.9 million Swiss francs ($12 million) for the year. That looks bad in a period when it made a 2.7 billion Swiss franc loss and was considering a potentially dilutive capital raise.
Alibaba rewrites its e-commerce playbook,"The European Union’s big birthday party will be an awkward affair. Heads of state will gather in Rome on Saturday to mark the anniversary of a treaty, signed by the EU’s six founding members in the Italian capital in March 1957, which promised to “lay the foundations of an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe”."
Morgan Stanley gives Goldman a lesson in diversity,"How do you say ""key-man risk"" in Japanese? Investors might need to think about that. For now, they are relaxed about a land scandal involving Premier Shinzo Abe. But the episode highlights a vulnerability. The country's ongoing grand economic overhaul is fashioned around a single man: it is called ""Abenomics"" for a reason."
BBC stars will gain from radical pay transparency,"Amazon is purchasing a cheap, curious trinket. The $400 billion Seattle-based online retailer is paying less than $1 billion for Souq.com, a Middle Eastern e-commerce upstart. Amazon gets a low-cost toehold in a region that's hard to conquer. That said, overseas buyers have a history of regretting purchases of shiny objects in this labyrinthine market."
Reckitt shows bigger rivals how it’s done,"The ad kings have faced criticism over questionable content. Now Google is in the hot seat as brands like L’Oreal pull their digital spending. Also, Lyft finds an opening as Uber hits roadblocks. Plus: Not all is copacetic between Goldman Sachs alumni in Washington."
Australian banks can digest capital hike move,"Next is taking fashion cues from bankers, which doesn’t mean just donning a Hermes tie. The British high-street clothing chain has subjected itself to a stress test, previously the preserve of the financial world. In the worst scenario, where the average branch’s sales dip 6 percent a year for a decade, the net profit margin of its store portfolio will halve. Openness about the problems facing retailers is welcome. But this voluntary exam glosses over big risks."
Guest view: Culture can’t be bank-reform casualty,"Life should be good again for China's insurance giants. Low interest rates and tougher capital rules made 2016 hard for mainland life insurers.

The troubled U.S. retailer warned it could be headed for bankruptcy if it can't reverse a brutal decline in annual sales and rising losses.

Inflation gives Bank of England a summer reprieve,"For fans of explicitly ethical stakeholder capitalism, Unilever’s rebuttal of a takeover approach by Kraft Heinz last month was a great moment. On one side, a company that made a big deal about thinking long term and creating good products as well as profit for shareholders. On the other, a business run by some of the harshest corporate cost-cutters around. With little more than a few phone calls, the Anglo-Dutch consumer product giant saw off the much smaller co"

Treasury's Mnuchin defends U.S. decision to lift sanctions on Russian firms,"Iceland and Greece are rare examples of European countries experimenting with capital controls.

Netflix triggers shareholders’ Pavlovian response,"Britain’s poor productivity faces a new threat from Brexit. As in most developed countries, UK companies are finding it harder to produce more without adding extra workers or capital. The notable exceptions are exporters and foreign-owned firms.

Peltz goes for the close shave at Procter & Gamble,A bid for Spotless cannot scrub clean private equity's reputation in Australia. On Tuesday leftfield bidder Downer EDI made a surprise A$1.3 billion ($1 billion) offer for the struggling cleaning and catering firm. That represents a reasonable premium to a beaten-up share price.

Britain’s 5G auction puts customers before coffers,"Vodafone has its eye firmly on the top spot in India. A $23 billion merger of the UK-based telecom giant’s Indian operations with Idea Cellular will create the nation's top mobile operator amid a bloody price war. The structure is less than ideal, however, because it aims to satisfy both companies, and give a big say to an Indian tycoon all at once."

Viewsroom: Elon Musk’s Down-Under wager,"China's plan to allow Hong Kong and mainland investors to trade each other's debt is good news for the Special Administrative Region. By making it easier for foreigners to trade onshore bonds, the tie-up means Chinese debt is more likely to join benchmark global indexes. And allowing Chinese investors into Hong Kong's fixed income market will deliver a fresh source of liquidity. Both results will benefit Hong Kong's financial industry."
Cox: White House kitchen-sink job going down drain,"France’s presidential election is fomenting deep anxiety in markets. Currency options prices show investors have rarely been so worried about how a single event might weaken the glue that holds the European Union together.

DACA not on negotiating table until Supreme Court weighs in: Pence,"For the first time since self-professed, easy-money real-estate developer Donald Trump became president, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate.

Trump cancels Davos trip amid ongoing U.S. government shutdown,Dutch voters have delivered a conventional kind of protest. The country’s ruling coalition suffered losses in Wednesday’s election as the electorate turned to opposition parties. But right-wing firebrand Geert Wilders picked up fewer seats than forecast. The setback for extremism leaves mainstream politics in the Netherlands more fragmented than ever.
Why Europe can’t beat Google on corporate taxes,"Anil Agarwal is betting the house on Africa. The Indian tycoon is making a personal bet on Anglo American worth up to 2 billion pounds through a fiddly, bond-financed deal. The raid signals a desire to build a global mining giant. There is little overlap with Agarwal's flagship London-listed Vedanta Resources, but a 12 percent stake would give him a prime position in the event of an Anglo breakup."
Hong Kong gaming IPO is not Razer sharp,"Trade surpluses are supposedly a menace.

Both sides have likely decided a marriage of convenience, if not of love, is the best they can hope for."
"Hadas: Fear not, you can get economics right","Philip Hammond’s budget U-turn is a profoundly destabilising event.

UK’s jobs review kinder to employers than workers,Ant Financial's march may be worth slowing down. A $1 billion offer for MoneyGram from Euronet Worldwide improves on the deal it agreed earlier this year with the payments arm of Jack Ma's e-commerce colossus Alibaba.

Blackstone’s diversification drive circles home,"Charlotte Hogg has done the right thing by stepping down from the Bank of England.

'My mortgage is due' Some U.S. federal workers seek shutdown cash,"China will struggle to sell Donald Trump on the status quo. The U.S. president has invited Xi Jinping to his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, various media reported on Monday, in an apparent retreat from campaign-trail threats to give China's president a McDonald's hamburger instead of a state banquet. While the leaders of the world's two largest economies will dine splendidly, the dinner conversation will probably be strained."
"House passes bill that would end shutdown, but Senate unlikely to take up","Intel has put the self-driving pedal to the financial metal. Buying Mobileye for $15.3 billion values the autonomous-car parts supplier at 30 times this year's estimated revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. Justifying such a racy price tag will take some doing."
Trump administration working on Arctic oil leases despite shutdown,"Scots have presented pro-European Brits with a light at the end of the Brexit tunnel - but it may yet be an oncoming train. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Monday formally called for a referendum on independence, two and a half years after Scots voted narrowly to stay in the United Kingdom. The small bump in the value of sterling against the dollar that followed her comments is premature."
TalkTalk’s focus on cheap may not be cheerful,"The Bank of England has an unenviable problem – what to do when a good employee does a bad thing. Incoming Deputy Governor Charlotte Hogg broke its own code of conduct by failing to declare her brother works at Barclays, one of the biggest institutions it regulates. If she stays, it would hurt the central bank’s reputation."
GIC’s shrinking returns add to Singapore’s gloom,"A brash politician with a distinctive quiff uses incendiary rhetoric to gain a popular following.

Vantiv sets punchy price on Worldpay,"The scarcity of people equipped to run Britain’s corporate boards is partly man-made. Jan du Plessis shows the problem. The Rio Tinto chairman is leaving the UK-listed miner for telecoms group BT to take up his fourth such role for a FTSE 100 company. The merry-go-round is not ideal, and shows a need for lateral thinking."
Billionaire environmentalist Steyer will not enter 2020 White House race,"Who picks up the tab for society’s shift toward looser work arrangements? New measures in Wednesday’s UK budget have an initial answer: the self-employed, who will hand over a greater share of their income to the taxman. It’s understandable, but only partially helps."
"Rosenstein, overseeing U.S. Russia probe, set to depart post",The world is losing patience with North Korea. A barrage of missile and nuclear tests coupled with the alleged murder of the half-brother of Pyongyang’s leader in Kuala Lumpur are irking even traditional friends such as China and Malaysia. Beijing’s recent decision to ban coal imports from its hermit neighbour suggests a fresh desire to tame it. Other pressure points exist but are delicate to push.
Trump says meeting with Democrats 'waste of time',"The White House’s cold shoulder could slow Donald Trump’s economic agenda.

Tencent’s e-books require some Hollywood stardust,"“First, do no harm.” Philip Hammond appears to have adopted the medic’s motto. The British finance minister used his spring budget to make a few cosmetic tweaks to taxes and spending. His surgical approach makes sense, but the as-yet uncertain costs of the country’s departure from the European Union could yet lead to a more graphic dismembering of his objectives."
Beijing-Trump relations enter dangerous phase,"In the 1980s, the makers of Stella Artois came up with a new way to advertise their premium lager. Instead of downplaying their product’s higher price tag, ad men successfully dubbed it “reassuringly expensive”. If those backing Britain’s exit from the European Union want to be taken seriously, they should take a similar approach to the Brexit bill that’s being threatened by EU negotiators."
Theresa May’s dilemma is Mark Carney’s opportunity,China has been giving fair warning. Telecoms equipment maker ZTE has agreed to plead guilty for violating U.S. export controls. The charges could have been more severe and the $892 million fine is manageable for the $9 billion company. More powerful is the message: the new U.S. administration is prepared to take action against corporate giants to rein in troublesome nations.
Theresa May’s dilemma is Mark Carney’s opportunity,"Citi is playing a smart game with China’s government bond market. The U.S. bank on Tuesday said  it will include sovereign debt issued by the People’s Republic in three existing fixed-income indices – the first major international benchmark provider to do so. That's a propaganda victory for Beijing, which has struggled to enthuse foreign investors. For Citi it’s a relatively low-risk diplomatic win."
Qatar standoff spells end of Gulf cooperation,"Spring is delivering a Brexit reality check to UK retailers. A slide in the value of sterling is boosting food and fuel costs, which is prompting shoppers to spend less on clothing, footwear, and other discretionary goods.

Naspers' addiction to Tencent is unhealthy,"Global tech giants are heading for a proxy war in India. Alibaba is leading a $200 million investment into Paytm’s marketplace, creating a new Indian unicorn.

Trump: I have 'absolute right' to declare emergency over border,"Drugmakers could lump Britain with a withdrawal problem.

A rally in the newly listed firm behind SF Express makes boss Wang Wei one of China's richest men. At roughly $40 billion, his company is now worth nearly as much as Deutsche Post.

A probable objection from the European Commission’s antitrust police is therefore no disaster."
Bank of England tries surrogate rate hike,"China may have another way to get around IPO reform: luring tech unicorns with easier listings. The securities watchdog is mulling faster IPO approvals for big tech names. Letting Jack Ma's Ant Financial, last valued at $60 billion, jump the queue may convince other entrepreneurs to list at home, eschewing venues in New York and Hong Kong. But this would be a poor substitute for meaningful reform."
Cable guys' Sprint lurch bound for crossed wires,"China's debt-to-equity swap plan is a complicated attempt to carry out a corporate turnaround in the People's Republic.

Germany can jump growth hurdle courtesy of Brexit,"Like any good private-equity investor, Carlyle has demonstrated a knack for buying when others are selling, and vice versa. It’s instructive then that the firm led by David Rubenstein is embarking on its biggest quest for distressed assets at a time when tax-cut hopes are fanning Wall Street euphoria. The $2.5 billion fund is a good reminder that lofty valuations, an aging recovery and a chaotic new administration can produce bad outcomes."

The new U.S. Treasury secretary says the post-election rally in the equities market reflects faith in President Donald Trump and his promises for tax reform and fiscal stimulus. Both plans need approval from Congress, and may be accompanied by higher inflation. Anti-immigrant and trade policies could also mute market gains."
Trump administration snubs European diplomats in U.S.: officials,"Numbers don’t lie. If only that saying were even halfway true.

Review: We're all behaviorists now - so what?,"Stepping back from the day-to-day at Nissan Motor is a good start for Carlos Ghosn. The workaholic had been combining four chairmanships and three chief executive roles – far too much for even the most indefatigable boss. Now Ghosn will cede Nissan's CEO role to company veteran Hiroto Saikawa, who has been warming up as co-CEO since October. That is laudable. Losing a few more titles would be even better."

Cox: Milan is dark horse in post-Brexit bank race,"Mining's traumatic downturn is still fresh in the memories of BHP Billiton and Anglo American, despite their improved performance in 2016. Rising commodities prices and aggressive cost-cutting helped both companies to boost earnings and cut debt. But another investment splurge or borrowing binge is unlikely. Financial prudence remains the priority."
"New app: Uber, but for an Uber CEO","Beijing seems to have put China's richest man on a leash. Hollywood website the Wrap says Wang Jianlin's $1 billion bid for Dick Clark Productions, via Wang's Dalian Wanda Group, has been killed by Chinese officials worried about the price tag and capital outflows. If true, this bodes ill for other Chinese firms on the prowl."
Theresa May’s plan still has hard Brexit core,Close shaves sometimes leave scars. Unilever boss Paul Polman can keep his M&A defence powder dry following Kraft Heinz's decision on Feb. 19 to walk away from its spurned bid. But the shock to the system will have an effect on the Anglo-Dutch food and household goods company.
Hadas: The constant challenge of deep-set problems,"Chinese insurers have developed a taste for equity, and regulators are rightly worried. They are increasingly concentrating their assets on individual company names. The danger is that a single default could hit them hard. The Chinese insurance watchdog is trying to curb this practice - but doing so could put paid to the industry's penchant for large acquisitions."
Trump has 'made no decision' whether to declare emergency over border wall: Pence,"Almost nothing made by Kraft Heinz or Unilever has an expiration date of just two days – except, that is, for their $143 billion merger. Kraft, the American ketchup-and-cheese concern controlled by Brazilian investment firm 3G, withdrew an offer to acquire its Anglo-Dutch counterpart on Sunday after an inopportune leak put the knickers of British politicians and unions in a twist. But the idea of pairing 3G's ruthless cost management with Unilever's innovative "
U.S. House committee queries airport staffing during shutdown,"The world's wiliest takeover artists have found their biggest target yet. Kraft Heinz, the Kool-Aid-to-Velveeta conglomerate, has offered $143 billion for Unilever, its Anglo-Dutch rival. Even for 3G Capital, the private investment firm behind Kraft Heinz, beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International, it's an audacious move. To land Unilever, which rejected the offer, Kraft Heinz may need to pass the hat around to shareh"
"Scenarios: How Trump, U.S. Congress might end border wall shutdown fight","A growing gig economy and tax system that rewards self-employment could hit the UK government's coffers. Jobs created by the likes of Uber flatter Britain's unemployment rate, and have helped to smooth out the worst effects of the financial crisis. But the less palatable implications of a surging gig economy are now dawning on Westminster: a potential 3.5 billion pound gap in tax receipts by 2022."
Governance coup caps first leg of Uber's journey,"There's only so much even the most powerful executive can accomplish from behind bars. Samsung Group's founding family heir Jay Y. Lee has been thrown into jail in an unprecedented corruption case. This kind of scandal could cost company bosses their jobs in other countries, but in South Korea, Lee's position is probably not at risk. Nevertheless his physical absence will leave Samsung without anyone steering the wheel. The uncertainty threatens to hobble big "
Glencore misreads Chinese tea leaves in bid battle,"For Nelson Peltz and his big investment in Procter & Gamble, the timing could be as important as the strategy. The pushy investor's Trian disclosed a $3.5 billion position in the Tide-to-Crest conglomerate on Tuesday, but not any proposals. Whatever he has in mind, consumer stocks like P&G are well positioned for a tougher economic environment."
China index inclusion more form than substance,The president's vacillating over firing national security adviser Michael Flynn is the kind of mistake that gets corporate chiefs fired. Toshiba deals its way to a $6.3 bln loss. California's water woes are a national wake-up call. And Wall Street parties like its 2007.
Jefferies plods in Morgan Stanley's footsteps,"Democrats taking control of the U.S. House of Representatives in January plan to send Special Counsel Robert Mueller the transcripts of testimony by some of President Donald Trump's closest associates so they can be reviewed for evidence and possible falsehoods, said three sources familiar with the matter."
Exchange Podcast: James Ledbetter,"After exhortations to build a wall and lock up Hillary Clinton, the most popular rallying cry during Donald Trump's campaign for the U.S. presidency was ""drain the swamp."" The phrase, which first surfaced as an anti-capitalist slogan a century ago, refers to the practice of drying up wetlands to stop mosquitoes from breeding. Since taking office less than a month ago it has become evident that Trump had a different definition in mind."
Barclays fraud case serves justice lukewarm,"Nestle's new boss is tweaking the Swiss consumer goods group's recipe, but the taste so far remains the same. Ulf Mark Schneider used his first outing as chief executive on Thursday to back away from a long-held goal of growing sales 5 to 6 percent. That's hardly daring: Nestle has fallen short four years running. Schneider has scope to shake things up much more - if he has a free hand."
Public housing pressure builds for next HK leader,"Another day, another credible Chinese economic indicator goes dark. Two independent indexes of red-hot property prices have quietly ceased publication recently. The country is growing more opaque both literally and figuratively, as smog intensifies and data blurs. Economists have been ordered to stay positive."
Blue Apron’s $3.2 bln debut could be its best dish,"Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer may soon be breathing a sigh of relief. The $40 billion internet company is on the verge of cutting the price of its core-business sale to Verizon Communications by $250 million to $350 million, less than a 10 percent discount to what was originally agreed, according to media reports. That would be a small price to pay for massive hacks that affected over 1 billion users' account data."
Amazon's one-click deal keeps Wal-Mart at bay,Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne has for years advocated consolidation in the car industry. A tie-up between Peugeot and Opel would prove his point but hurt his company.
Asia’s buyouts are priced for unlikely perfection,"Masayoshi Son is fond of his ""crazy ideas."" Splashing out $3.3 billion for Fortress Investment, an alternative-investment firm, is unexpected but not exactly crazy. SoftBank, the Japanese entrepreneur's tech and telecoms group, has big ambitions in investing, and the New York-based firm knows how to put money to work."
"Trump threatens years-long government shutdown, emergency powers to build wall","Carlos Tavares has shown he can quickly turn around troubled European carmakers. Within three years of him taking charge at PSA Group, the French company’s profit margin has tripled. Now Tavares may be preparing to take on a new challenge by acquiring General Motors’ troubled European unit."
U.S. delays key agriculture reports due to government shutdown,"The first career businessman to occupy the Oval Office has many corporate analogues to help him navigate his first major political scandal. Like messes that roiled large public companies from Wells Fargo to Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the rising furor over the U.S. national security adviser's misleading statements about his dealings with Russia point to a common problem: the management style of the chief executive."
Top U.S. Senate Republican: staffers to seek deal to end shutdown,"Toshiba has opted for drastic action. On Tuesday, the struggling Japanese group unveiled a $6.3 billion writedown, a plunge into negative equity, an end to building new nuclear plants, and the resignation of its chairman. The delivery was chaotic but those messages had already been well-telegraphed, and Chairman Shigenori Shiga's involvement with the troublesome nuclear business made his position clearly untenable. The possible sale of a majority of its most v"
Cox: NBC's fake-news foray could have real fallout,"Chinese oil and gas conglomerate Sinochem is looking to buy into Singapore-listed Noble Group, Reuters has reported. Joining a capital hike last summer would have been a cheaper way into the energy trader. But with much of Noble’s restructuring done and commodities prices rising there could still be upside for Sinochem, provided it moves fast."
Amazon buys its way to the top of the food chain,"U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office said on Tuesday President Donald Trump's ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn provided ""substantial"" cooperation with its probe into possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow."
Breakdown: Britain’s precarious pre-Brexit pact,"Allergan has added ice and a slice to its M&A cocktail. The drug company is paying just under $2.5 billion for Zeltiq Aesthetics and its diet-avoiding, fat-freezing tech. It sounds a wackier play than the dozen deals Allergan struck last year. But vain customers pay cold cash for the treatment, making it less speculative than other acquisitions, like gene therapy."
Breakdown: Britain’s precarious pre-Brexit pact,"It’s the epitome of a difficult sell. The UK's Co-operative Bank put itself on the market on Monday, citing progress on its turnaround plan. But this is a lender in a ferociously competitive market, likely to fall short of capital requirements, and whose erstwhile ethical brand was tarnished by media revelations that its former chairman – then a Methodist minister – binged on rent boys and crystal meth. Prospective buyers will need fortitude – and a low enough pr"
Packaging veteran ticks right boxes for BHP,"There is no Trump card in dealing with North Korea. President Donald Trump has used his unique form of diplomacy to soften potential conflicts between the United States and trade partners Japan and China. Pyongyang, which fired a missile on Sunday, is more troublesome. Unlike its neighbours, the hermit state offers little room for common ground on jobs or commerce. Trump’s business savvy will be of little use."
Viewsroom: We need to talk about Uber 2.0,"Daniel Tarullo is giving banks a generous parting gift. The tough Federal Reserve governor told President Donald Trump on Friday that he is resigning five years before his term expires in 2022. Tarullo was the most influential architect of post-crisis financial reform, including the stress tests. His exit may be one of the biggest determinants of how banks are overseen."
Wells Fargo drives stagecoach further into mud,"It's what Donald Trump might call a ""classy"" problem: How to spend $21.6 billion. That's the amount the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the president's promised wall on the border with Mexico will cost, according to an internal report seen by Reuters. Even without the overruns that would probably jack the price up, it's a bad investment choice."
Spain’s model bank bail-in leaves lasting scars,"The U.S. Federal Reserve can be a dry topic. Danielle DiMartino Booth makes it anything but. Her new book ""Fed Up: An Insider's Take on Why the Federal Reserve is Bad for America,"" lays out the critique in intelligent, entertaining style. With the insistence of someone who saw the 2008 financial crisis coming and was largely ignored, she pulls few punches."
Holding: White House holds trump card in gift suit,"The success or failure of Reckitt Benckiser's $17 billion deal will be decided in China. The cleaning products-to-condoms group is splashing out $90 a share in cash for baby formula-maker Mead Johnson. Cost savings only justify around half the $3.8 billion premium, though. Making up the balance depends largely on boosting sales in the People's Republic."
Chinese firms are running short on funding options,"Apple is planting the seeds for India's iPhone awakening. The $695 billion company is nearing a deal to assemble its iconic phone in Karnataka, a southwestern state in one of the world's fastest growing handset markets. That would help lower retail prices and boost potential sales at a time when the Cupertino-based firm is losing its footing elsewhere in Asia."
Supreme Court to hear challenge to ban on profane trademarks,"Anthem and Cigna may have one fight left. Their $54 billion deal was nixed on Wednesday by a federal judge, who agreed with the U.S. Justice Department's competition concerns. In addition to fighting the government, the two health insurers had been squabbling with each other over the merger. That suggests the break fee could be contentious, too."
Trump denies media report he is considering Webb for Pentagon chief,"President Trump wants to ""do a number"" on post-crisis financial reforms, but overturning them will be tough. Paris emerges as the top city for financial types after Brexit. Plus, why a legal brief filed by Google and others against Trump's immigration ban is such an unusual move."
Trump denies media report he is considering Jim Webb for Pentagon chief,"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has approved a request to extend the deployment of troops to the U.S. border with Mexico until the end of January, a U.S. official said on Tuesday, a move that had been largely expected."
Anbang drama is coda to China’s M&A craze,"Ashmore is giving emerging market funds a spot of good news. The developing economy specialist is seeing rising profits and demand for its products. That’s heartening, given the triple threat of Trumpian protectionism, Federal Reserve rate rises and the steady pressure on fees."
J.Crew bond revamp is roadmap for asset transfers,"Publicis boss Maurice Levy just messed up his successor's kitchen sink. The one inalienable right of incoming chief executives is the scope to immediately take big provisions against past errors. Arthur Sadoun will find executing his own ""kitchen-sinking"" trickier."
Political mess puts Bank of England on the spot,"Chinese rainmakers are becoming a headache. Global banks still need them to navigate the country's corporate waters. But sudden disappearances of corporate and financial tycoons make high-flying staff a risky commodity. Compliance costs are rising, while their potential is shrinking."
Exchange Podcast: Tony Ressler,"There are many reasons for dismay at U.S. President Donald Trump's latest Twitter tantrum against a private capitalistic enterprise. Nordstrom, the retailer founded by a Swedish immigrant who arrived in America in 1887 at age 16 with just $5, is the latest target. The Seattle-based chain decided to stop selling first daughter Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories due to lackluster sales. During a moment when the president was thought to be attending a"
Yahoo investors are U.S. tax-reform skeptics,"Dan Loeb is getting too bullish on banks. In his latest letter to investors in Third Point, the high-profile hedge-fund manager argues that a combination of rate hikes and operating leverage will jack up returns for U.S. lenders and investment banks before any tax cuts or regulation take effect."
EU clearing row shows limits of UK taking control,"LVMH is coming round to a “small is beautiful” mindset. The luxury group attained its 94 billion euro market capitalisation via an M&A spree a decade ago, but is now changing tack. Investing in small, promising startups is worth a go – but French peers Danone and L’Oreal already tried something similar."
Biotech IPO rejuvenates Hong Kong market,"China's forex reserves have fallen below $3 trillion for the first time in nearly six years in January. The rate of contraction has slowed as China closes up its capital account, but for a country obsessed with symbolic numbers, targets, quotas and index levels, a worrying line in the sand has been crossed."
Getting Uber out of reverse hard for whoever's CEO,"Silicon Valley is fighting for its life on immigration. Over 100 tech firms, including Google, Facebook and Apple, have joined the legal battle against President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily barring the entry of nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. They argue that the restrictions interfere with hiring and business operations. For an industry dependent on immigrants, that truth is self-evident and worth defending."
GE's CEO choice pushes the boundaries,"U.S. bankers are suddenly full of hope. They reckon Donald Trump will roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms, enacted to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the president's executive order calling for a review, signed on Friday, does little that's concrete. Meanwhile, any talk of diluting the rules has Democrats howling."
British parties all gain if they share Brexit pain,"There is no more cliché pairing than a Hermes tie with an investment banker in a tailored suit. So it is only fitting that Paris – where the luxury goods firm began in a small workshop 180 years ago – would emerge as a frontrunner over Frankfurt, Amsterdam and other European cities to pick up many of the financial industry castaways who will be sent packing by Brexit."

Pelosi regains gavel as speaker of most diverse U.S. House ever,"Bob Iger may swing for a three-peat. The Walt Disney chief executive is considering delaying for the third time his departure from atop the House of Mouse. It's a sign the media conglomerate has failed in efforts to find his replacement since Tom Staggs left last year. Clinging to power, though, can get messy."
MSCI's China index inclusion risks liquid headache,"The curse of the frontrunner is proving brutal in the French presidential race. Financial scandal has hurt the presidential chances of early favourite Francois Fillon, who came from behind to win the centre-right party’s primaries. Independent reformer Emmanuel Macron has gained, but there is also an opportunity for the business-unfriendly hard left to exploit."
Macron's reform mandate is shakier than it looks,"Audi on Sunday made an emotive plea for gender equality in its Super Bowl TV commercial, calling for equal pay for equal work. The cause is honourable. But as the German luxury carmaker's own tepid achievements show, action is harder than fine rhetoric."
Jamie Dimon succession becomes mystery-horse race,"Super Bowl 51 will involve tackling more than just New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons. The National Football League's championship game on Sunday caps a tough year for the league. Though 100 million people are expected to tune in, TV ratings have been down all year. Throw in sponsors tapping into the post-election rancor and a U.S. president with an old grudge against the league and it could be brutal."
Review: Zippy Uber trip gets barely halfway there,"Who benefits if Greece defaults on its debts? Neither its creditors nor its obstreperous government. That is the best reason to hope that tense talks on whether the country deserves the next slice of an 86 billion euro bailout will end amicably before around 6 billion euros of debt comes due for repayment in July. If rationality prevails Greece will still be in a mess, but not at the brink."
Sterling post-election blues will be slow to lift,"India may see bigger as easier. Tucked into the budget released on Wednesday was a plan to create national champions, starting in the oil sector. The idea pairs industrial logic with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s love of grand gestures, and desire to see India make a bigger mark on the international stage. Such state capitalism looks like a marriage of convenience."
Jack Ma's data ambitions get investor green light,"The parent of the Snapchat smartphone app thinks it's ""a camera company."" It's almost as if its initial public offering filing on Thursday – which may raise up to $3 billion and see the company valued at up to $25 billion – was somehow confused with GoPro's from a few years ago, when the camera-hardware maker said it was in the media business."
Theresa May falls victim to anti-incumbent wave,"The parent of the Snapchat smartphone app thinks it's ""a camera company."" It's almost as if its initial public offering filing on Thursday – which may raise up to $3 billion and see the company valued at up to $25 billion – was somehow confused with GoPro's from a few years ago, when the camera-hardware maker said it was in the media business."
Weak government may be just what Britain needs,"Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos is famous for brushing off profit concerns. The fourfold increase in the $400 billion online retailer's 2016 profit from a year earlier, reported on Thursday, was a pleasant surprise. But true to form, the company may spend more than analysts thought it would in the first quarter. Bezos still prefers investment to earnings."
Comey callout of Trump lies hurts dealmaking hopes,"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, informed Trump about a conversation he had with the Kremlin seeking help to build a skyscraper in Moscow in 2016 during the U.S. presidential campaign, according to a court filing."
Nordstrom could be well suited for a buyout,"President Trump's trade-tariff threats and his temporary immigration ban risk undermining business-friendly policies like deregulation and tax cuts. Meanwhile, he has nominated a Supreme Court justice. And Under Armour takes center stage in the battle for shareholder rights."
Justice Department probing Trump's former Interior chief Zinke: Washington Post,"Independent M&A shops face a tricky 2017. Evercore, Greenhill and Lazard, which reported estimates-beating earnings on Thursday, proved their resilience last year by weathering a choppy environment better than most big bank rivals. Continued success, though, requires confident clients. And they are looking for President Donald Trump and Congress to ensure that happens."
U.S. government shutdown further strains immigration system,"Reckitt Benckiser boss Rakesh Kapoor needs some elbow grease to make his next deal sparkle. The British Brasso-to-Vanish maker is in talks to buy baby formula maker Mead Johnson for $16.7 billion. Without synergies, the deal’s return on investment is 4 percent. Scrubbing that up to more acceptable levels may require boosting the target’s operating profit by almost 60 percent. That looks punchy, even for Reckitt."
Senate will only consider shutdown-ending bills Trump would sign: McConnell,"As bonus season starts, China's traders are at the sharp end. A retrenchment after 2015's market crash means many brokerage staff are braced for smaller payouts. Off the trading floor, life looks better, but not sustainably so."
Macron has chance to make France a better investor,Facebook beat expectations on both the top and bottom line despite concerns its business is poised to slow. The stellar results underscore the grip Facebook has over its nearly 2 billion users. Proving it can overcome such dominance will be rival Snap's big challenge ahead of its IPO.
Hong Kong draws short straw at hedge-fund jamboree,"Nutritional supplements are having a healthy effect on Carlyle. The buyout firm may be ready to part with Nature's Bounty. At the $6 billion price tag reported by Bloomberg, it would deliver a substantial return for what was a pivotal deal in 2010."
British election offers business only bad choices,Julius Baer's pure play approach to private banking is showing up its biggest competitor. Switzerland's third-largest wealth manager pulled in more net new money in percentage terms than industry leader UBS in the second half of the year. Baer's simpler proposition is a big attraction.
Banks hold key to Noble Group’s future,"Donald Trump has begun his Supreme courtship. He nominated Neil Gorsuch to replace Antonin Scalia, which would restore a slim conservative majority. There are many reasons to suspect that this could be only the start of a long association with the highest court in the land."
GM speeds away from Einhorn toward nastier traffic,"Apple is working harder to squeeze juice out of its iconic iPhone. The company sold more units in the holiday quarter, yet profit fell. A saturating market and slowing innovation aren't helping margins. Yet the prospect of a new phone and the ability to sell additional services are bright spots that should keep investors on board."
Viewsroom: The UK goes to the polls,U.S. trials could be courting a comeback. Customers cried foul when Wells Fargo stifled their lawsuits over fake accounts. Judges also ruled last month that the Securities and Exchange Commission's in-house tribunals were unconstitutional. Now the Supreme Court is considering a revival of the right of workers to sue. Cracking open the courthouse door would breathe new life into American justice.

China can remake North Korea in its own image,Under Armour's founder-led approach is wearing thin. The $12 billion athletic-wear maker reported its slowest top-line growth in eight years and signaled more challenges ahead. Its chief financial officer is also bailing. The news wiped a quarter off the company's market value. Chief Executive Kevin Plank's strategy of maintaining power is underperforming badly.
UK cyberspace crackdown faces reality checks,"Volkswagen has given its departing compliance chief a payout that is more reminiscent of a booming American investment bank than a stricken German carmaker. Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt is receiving around 12 million euros for just over one year of service. For all the extenuating circumstances, the award underscores why VW needs to revamp executive pay."
Saudi-Qatar rift is old theme with Trumpian twist,"Vodafone has dialed for backup in its India fight. The UK-based telco is talking to Aditya Birla Group about an all-share merger of its Indian business with Idea Cellular, part-owned by the cement-to-retail group. It could feel the benefits beyond the subcontinent."
'I won': Trump rebuffs criticism from incoming Senator Romney,"Hours before Woodrow Wilson took the oath of office for the U.S. presidency on March 4, 1913, his predecessor William Taft signed an act establishing a new branch of the federal government to give workers a ""voice in the cabinet."" The Labor Department was created ""to foster, promote and develop the welfare of working people, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."""
Trump asks congressional leaders to return for shutdown talks Friday: lawmaker,"French elections are worrying credit investors more than Britain's exit from the European Union. While ratings agencies see little chance of either country going bust, it now costs over a third more to insure against a Gallic default than a British one. The scope to weaken its currency is what makes the United Kingdom a slightly better credit risk."
Factbox: Impact on U.S. government widens on 12th day of shutdown,"""Becoming Warren Buffett"" is more personal than business. In a new documentary produced by U.S. cable network HBO, the Berkshire Hathaway mega-billionaire shares old home movies and lets down his guard a bit. The ambitious effort to get past Buffett's well-worn homilies, however, puts his late wife Susie into the starring role of not just the film, but also his charmed life."
Attacks on UK add tension to “strong and stable”,"Investing in UBS is a bet on an uncertain world. The Swiss private bank reckons resurgent investors may boost its tepid 6.1 percent return on equity for 2016. But after a fourth quarter marked by net outflows of 5.4 billion Swiss francs ($5.4 billion) and a further withering of wealth management margins, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti’s hopes for a pick-up in activity need quick consummation."
Hadas: Climate not real loser from Trump tantrum,"Retail is like a game of tug-of-war. Customers, stores and suppliers all want to capture a bigger share of the spoils. Tesco's near-20 billion pound merger with wholesale food supplier Booker is a way for Britain's dominant supermarket group to get a tighter grip on the rope, at least for a while."

Cracking open the courthouse door would breathe new life into American justice.
Mark Carney's inflation fight hits close to home,Jack Ma's Ant Financial has got itself an American colony. The $880 million purchase of remittances firm MoneyGram looks like a counterintuitive bet in a de-globalizing world for the Alibaba founder's financial-services arm. International payments are a tough business. But MoneyGram gives Ant a U.S. base with tunnels to many developing markets.
Art world upstart sprays tech fortune on canvas,Former FBI Director James Comey asked a federal judge on Thursday to quash a congressional subpoena from Republicans on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee who are trying to compel him to testify behind closed doors about his decision-making ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
Viewsroom: Donald Trump can’t melt Paris accord,"Two competing tariff ideas from President Trump and congressional Republicans bring merits but mostly unforeseen risks. Meanwhile, any cut in the corporate tax rate will benefit hapless Yahoo and its Asian holdings. Plus, why it pays to bet against Davos Man's thinking."
Cox: Sgt. Pepper also taught the board to play,"Germany’s job miracle has a dark side: growing inequality. This could threaten Angela Merkel’s bid to win a fourth term as chancellor in September elections, even though employment is at an all-time high and real incomes have risen markedly."
Akzo is emblem for new “fortress Europe”,"Syngenta has hedge funds sifting Chinese tea leaves. A sharp shift in sentiment over the Swiss agribusiness group's $43 billion sale to ChemChina, the state-backed giant, shows how Beijing's influence complicates life for merger arbitrageurs."
China’s growth obsession fosters collateral fraud,Cisco Systems is chasing a fairy tale. The networking giant's core switch and router businesses face tough times. Buying software firm AppDynamics for $3.7 billion offers some respite from hardware woes. But the company is paying well over the odds to add a bit of excitement to its story.
Trump climate exit has bright silver lining,"There's a lot of talk these days about borders and taxes in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to hit firms that outsource with a simple tariff on imports. Republicans in Congress have pitched a more complex idea, a border adjustment, built into a corporate-tax overhaul. Breakingviews ticks through the winners and losers."
U.S. Navy pursuing block buy of two aircraft carriers: senator,"Theresa May’s encounter with Donald Trump on Friday is a moment of truth for post-Brexit UK. If UK and U.S. leaders agree to open up $203 billion of annual trade it would be a positive - for their economies and for Britain's divorce proceedings with the European Union. The cost is modest nose-holding, and a willingness to settle for fast and flaunt-worthy, rather than deep and comprehensive."
Factbox: Departments hit by partial U.S. government shutdown,Intesa SanPaolo's insurance mega merger could be a tough sell. Chief Executive Carlo Messina has won investor kudos for running Italy's strongest and most profitable large bank. Splashing out on the 24 billion euro Generali - which is now a real possibility after Intesa admitted interest in the insurer on Jan. 24 - looks like the kind of dealmaking Intesa has thus far done well to avoid. 
Democrat Warren takes step to challenge Trump in 2020,"Asian wealth management is an increasingly elite business. High costs threaten the viability of private banking in the region, even though it is now home to the world's largest population of high-net-worth individuals. That is forcing stragglers to quit. The clear winners will be mega-houses like UBS and rising regional champion DBS, which can build on their scale and cut costs."
Exxon climate vote puts sector on notice,"Buy Amazon stock, short everything European – and don't count out the family automobile just yet. Those are three ideas to emerge from our second annual survey of Breakingviews readers, conducted at live events held in New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore discussing our Predictions 2017 book. If last year's results are anything to go by, our followers' prognostications are worth heeding."
Hadas: Ending the hyperbole over pension savings,"Decision making at Avis may be going the way of its famed slogan, ""We try harder."" The $3.2 billion rental-car outfit scrapped the motto almost five years ago after five decades of service. The poison pill it just adopted suggests the board has stopped heeding the message, too."

Samsung gambles on an heirless future,"Brexit sceptics have won the battle, but will lose the war. Britain's Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a previous ruling that Prime Minister Theresa May could not pull Britain out of the European Union without consulting members of parliament. The catch for jubilant Remainers is that it probably won't stop the same lawmakers voting the exit through."
Goldman steps in avoidable $2.8 bln Venezuela mess,"It's time Japan's reformers tackled the buyout bullies. For all Tokyo has done to make firms better run and more profitable, minority investors remain vulnerable to mistreatment."
IAG can weather turbulence at BA,Foxconn's $7 billion U.S. bet goes beyond politics. Building a huge TV-screen factory in America would fit neatly with President Donald Trump's push to create domestic jobs. Grabbing a share of the U.S. market could also help the Taiwanese iPhone maker revive recently acquired subsidiary Sharp.
Ambani dials up the pain in sibling rivalry,"Industrial strategy, like polio, basically disappeared from Britain in the 1980s. Prime Minister Theresa May is bringing it back, with a plan to boost British industries set to be announced on Monday. Such a programme could be helpful, if the government focuses on the big picture. Otherwise, the squeakiest wheels might get the grease."
Trump’s Paris accord call will be anticlimactic,"Malaysia is still struggling to put its sovereign-fund scandal behind it. Prime Minister Najib Razak was not named in lawsuits filed last year by the U.S. Department of Justice after billions disappeared from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, and he has deftly avoided a legal tangle on his home turf. Nonetheless, the fallout is keeping Malaysia's leader on his toes."
UK Labour Party’s soft Brexit would still be hard,"Donald Trump is doubling down on protectionism. He used his first speech as the 45th president of the United States of America to echo his campaign rhetoric, presenting a dark picture of ""American carnage"" and decay at his inauguration. He's using it to justify his remedy of ending overseas assistance to focus on growth at home. That, though, is likely to quickly come up against harsh global economic realities."
UK Labour Party’s soft Brexit would still be hard,"Heineken hopes that Dutch courage will succeed where Japanese adventurism didn't. The beer company is in talks to buy the Brazilian unit of Kirin, and may pay $872 million, according to Japanese media. Landing a deal would give the company close to a 20 percent market share, still well behind dominant rival Anheuser-Busch InBev. The target is loss-making, but Heineken has reason to believe it could do a better job."
More Americans blame Trump for government shutdown: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"An outbreak of common sense may come too late to stop bankers leaving London. The City is the European Union's main capital market, and a big source of tax revenue for the United Kingdom. So both sides have good reason to negotiate a sensible post-Brexit agreement on financial services. For banks considering moving staff to the continent, though, what really matters is the timetable."
"Congress meets briefly, takes no steps to end shutdown","China's economic statistics may be damned as lies by sceptics, but they aren't fake enough for comfort."
"Schumer: Democrats, Republicans far apart on U.S. government funding",Ballooning student debt has been increasingly compared to subprime mortgages. That helps explain why the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just ripped a page out of the crisis playbook and accused loan servicer Navient of cheating borrowers paying for college. Suing just 48 hours before Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th American president is nevertheless a bold gambit by the same agency that nailed Wells Fargo for opening fake accounts.
Fox pokes sleeping advertising bear,"A group of moderates in the U.S. House of Representatives struck a deal on Wednesday to change procedural rules, boosting Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's chances of regaining the speaker's gavel in January."
Holding: Courts may save startups from redemptions,"Team Trump is AWOL at the World Economic Forum's annual alpine shindig while Theresa May's Brexit plan has people on edge. That left it to China's Xi Jinping to defend globalization. Elsewhere, U.S. bank earnings disappoint. And Snapchat considers making investor rights disappear."
Viewsroom: Trump budgets his way to la-la land,"The strategic appeal of French aerospace group Safran’s bid for plane-parts maker Zodiac could become the deal’s biggest obstacle. The part-stock offer, which values the target at 9.7 billion euros including debt, only flies, the bidder says, if half the target’s shareholders accept cash. Strip out the company’s controlling families, who want shares, and that half turns into 73 percent. But that may be a tough call as Safran’s superior performance, plus the prosp"
Post-election Merkel could change her spots,Samsung Group is leading U.S. hedge fund Elliott away from its comfort zone. A national corruption scandal and the unclear fate of the group's de facto leader Jay Y. Lee cast uncertainty over the investor's second big showdown in South Korea and most high-profile bet in Asia.
Post-election Merkel could change her spots,"Financially speaking, Netflix has come to embody the title of one of its new hit shows: ""Stranger Things."" The video-streaming service blew past quarterly subscriber expectations, as it celebrated a decade of being online. After burning through still more cash, its share price soared to a new high. Apparently growth can come at almost any cost."
Post-election Merkel could change her spots,"What does President Donald Trump mean for the world? That's the first question out of the mouths of the 3,000-plus earnest globalists gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum. Unfortunately for them, the principal actors in the impending regime change in Washington aren't around to answer in person. That leaves the few hundred American business leaders in attendance to field their international counterparts' queries. Herewith"
Market forces fail working women in Asian hubs,Pearson boss John Fallon's latest profit warning earns him an F. It is time for him to go.
Hadas: The next financial crisis could be in forex,"A Donald Trump-shaped void has enabled Xi Jinping to cosy up to Davos Man. Addressing the World Economic Forum for the first time, China's president defended globalisation and cooperation. Such calls are two-a-penny at the annual talking shop for the global elite, but this was a strikingly international and inclusive vision for a Chinese leader. If the United States turns inward under its new president, Beijing could wield more clout in everything fro"
Glencore food binge could leave investors hungry,"HNA Group is hoping to buy a SkyBridge directly to the White House with its latest deal. The Chinese conglomerate is taking a stake in newly minted presidential adviser Anthony Scaramucci's hedge fund. The business fit is a stretch, but the rationale of HNA making a friend on Trump's team as it tries to expand in the United States is hard to avoid."
Indian yogi shows power of local consumer kings,"One of Donald Trump's nominees is spreading the insider-trading disease. Georgia Representative Tom Price, tapped to be U.S. health and human services secretary, has raised new conflicts-of-interest concerns. He bought shares in publicly traded companies while working on bills affecting them."
Trump defends Syria pullout during surprise visit to Iraq,"If an instrument existed to measure the direction of political winds, it would be in Stanley Black & Decker's tool kit. The $18 billion maker of circular saws, screwdrivers and corded garden cultivators kicked off the year by drafting a blueprint for deals in the Donald Trump epoch with its purchase of the Craftsman brand from Sears."
U.S. acting AG falsely claimed scholar-athlete honor: report,"Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith won a U.S. Senate special election runoff in conservative Mississippi on Tuesday, defeating a black challenger after a campaign that recalled the history of racist violence in the deep South state."
Trump 'very happy' with Treasury chief Mnuchin: White House adviser,"Britain’s prime minister just took the business leader approach to complex turnarounds. Smart incoming chief executives sometimes start by taking big accounting provisions against their predecessors’ projects. That creates a clean slate, makes future earnings look better, and lends the new broom an air of decisiveness. Theresa May’s vision of Brexit, sketched out on Jan. 17, could have a similar effect."
Suicide bombing brings tragic twist to UK election,"Job-hopping is rife in the notoriously competitive Chinese labour market, and multinationals are losing their edge in the fight to recruit top executives, a survey shows. Fortunately they still hold a valuable advantage: the key to an international career at a time when many qualified Chinese professionals are fleeing the country's toxic air and overloaded school systems."
HNA sees Value in connecting East and West,"LeEco's rescue is rewarding bad habits. Hong Kong-listed property developer Sunac China is ploughing funds worth more than half its market value into the sprawling and overstretched TVs-to-electric cars group led by billionaire Jia Yueting. The partnership makes Jia's earlier pledge to slow down sound unconvincing, and could lead Sunac astray too."
Wal-Mart’s online therapy may revive ailing retail,"Politics could flatter or flatten global economic growth in the next two years. That’s the two-handed conclusion drawn by the latest projections from the International Monetary Fund. The promise of U.S. tax cuts under President-elect Donald Trump could give America and the world a boost, but his protectionist tendencies would have the opposite effect. The uncertainty makes economic forecasting more fraught than usual."
CEO ejection hardly gets Ford back in the race,"Luxottica and Essilor's plan to merge looks more corrective than visionary. The Italian eyewear group is backing a 50 billion euro union with the French lens-maker, and Luxottica founder Leonardo Del Vecchio is willing to cede control and some value to get the deal done. For the Italian group's other shareholders, that's probably a fair price for fixing governance issues, and perhaps selling more specs."
Spain is beginning to look more like Italy,"America's big banks are laying out their base-case to Washington, D.C. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all generated enough profit to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. Even so, none performed near well enough to justify stock gains since the U.S. election last November."
Clarity missing from SoftBank's $100 bln Vision,"America's big banks are laying out their base-case to Washington, D.C.

Even so, none performed near well enough to justify stock gains since the U.S. election last November."
OPEC caught in vicious Permian cycle,"Fiat Chrysler investors are betting that emissions issues in the United States are a muddle, rather than a fiddle. The carmaker's Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne on Jan. 12 vigorously denied any intentional emissions cheating and confirmed an ambitious 2018 financial target. The next day the group's shares rebounded smartly."
Review: Democrats' chief firebrand fumbles message,China Resources has secured an elegant exit from an ugly fight. The state-owned conglomerate is selling its entire 15.3 percent stake in China Vanke for $5.4 billion to Shenzhen Metro. It is an attractive price for the long-time shareholder to get out of the country’s second largest property developer by sales. And it may herald the beginning-of-the-end of a high profile battle for control of the company which has irked regulators.
Singapore Airlines and Cathay fight same headwinds,"It's hard to predict anything about Donald Trump's presidency. That's true for the approval of AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, too. At the very least, U.S. watchdogs could demand concessions from the telecom firm to allow the merger. One could be disposing of news network CNN."

U.S. envoy in fight against Islamic State quits after Syria pullout,"Amazon is repackaging a special delivery for 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The man moving in ordered jobs from around the country and the e-commerce titan says it can supply 100,000 of them by mid-2018. That sounds impressive, but also tracks Amazon's workforce growth of late. It's just the sort of box with a bow, however, that seems to satisfy the intended recipient."
"With no deal, U.S. government shutdown likely to drag on past Christmas","The president-elect's attempt to avoid conflicts of interest while in the White House is window dressing that sets a bad example for his administration. Meanwhile, Trump's shadow hangs over the Detroit Auto Show. And his infrastructure plan is not as straightforward as it seems."
States help run U.S. National Parks in federal government shutdown,Full-priced fashion is the new black. Strong pre-Christmas sales at UK retailers Marks & Spencer and Debenhams show efforts to wean customers off promotions are paying off. Fewer discounts should translate into better margins. But the temptation to hoist the “sale” signs may return as inflation and weaker growth squeeze British consumers. 
Theresa May’s manifesto leaves Brexit wiggle room,"China can only do so much to make life harder for South Korea. Beijing appears to be taking economic revenge against Seoul over a missile defence deal with the United States. Sectors riding the ""Korean wave"" in China, such as cosmetics, tourism and entertainment, are hurting. But $100 billion-plus manufacturing ties between the two nations are much harder to break. Excessive harshness would backfire on China."
China's confused market strategy reveals old flaws,"Pharma is paying for getting too comfy with Donald Trump. The president-elect on Wednesday accused the industry of ""getting away with murder"" on drug prices. Investors had dismissed his earlier pledge to renegotiate costs as campaign rhetoric easily outweighed by tax cuts. By close of trading on Tuesday, the Nasdaq Biotech Index had risen 8 percent since the election, a similar rise to the S&P 500. Its near 3 percent fall caused by his latest stance should forc"
Wall Street waking up to Washington reality,Donald Trump just struck a bad deal for the U.S. economy. The president-elect has decided that the way for him to avoid conflicts of interest while in the Oval Office is to put his assets into a trust managed by his sons and severely restrict their ability to do any deals. The measures fall short of generally accepted ethics standards - and hand a potentially powerful weapon to his opponents in the Senate.
Viewsroom: CEO presidency needs boardroom pushback,"The merger escape hatch may be about to open. President-elect Donald Trump's unnerving tweets and fickle policy ideas add to the angst already undermining transactions like Abbott Laboratories' $5.8 billion acquisition of medical-test maker Alere. Buyers seek solace in material adverse change, or MAC, clauses that offer the potential to wriggle out of a deal between signing and closing, but the provisions are almost never enforced in court. That may be about to"
Amazon is prescription for pharmacy woes,"Christmas is bestowing a belated gift on Britain's economic bulls. Supermarkets J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison both beat sales expectations over the festive season. Such numbers are closely watched because some general retailers make as much as 45 percent of their annual revenue towards the end of the year. Consumer sentiment is as important as the amount spent, and the signs so far are encouraging."
Britain’s joyless job boom is nothing to celebrate,Volkswagen has been saved by its U.S. failures. The German carmaker is close to a $4.3 billion (4.1 billion euro) settlement of criminal charges for manipulating emissions data of American diesel vehicles in the United States. It could have been a lot worse had VW's American sales hit expectations.
TPG gets crafty on Etsy investment from buyout fund,"Alibaba founder Jack Ma, one of first major Chinese business executives to meet Donald Trump, knows how to sell a deal. The e-commerce tycoon told the president-elect his company will create one million U.S. jobs. Trump, whose manifesto has been largely based on promises of creating employment, was predictably pleased, and says he and Ma will do ""great things"" together. There is less to both statements than meets the eye.   "
Lloyds bailout bill still isn’t paid in full,Ask Memphis residents and they might say that President Donald Trump got this one right: this is the best job market as far as many in this majority black city can remember.
Jack Ma's buy-and-pay supremacy looks less certain,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International's failed strategy has a grain of truth at its center. Drugmakers spend over $50 billion a year on research and development, but the payoff keeps declining. Valeant attempted to address the problem by acquiring companies, slashing R&D outlays and jacking up prices to keep the top line growing. But its aggressive approach backfired."
ValueAct practices what it preaches on succession,"Alibaba shareholders are getting another serving of bricks and mortar. The Chinese e-commerce giant is upping its stake in struggling mainland department store and mall operator Intime Retail, teaming up with founder Shen Guojun to offer to take the firm private for $2.6 billion."
Government to shut down in fight over Trump's border wall,"Iraq could wrong-foot traders betting against its agreed OPEC cuts. The cartel's second-largest producer has little to gain either financially or politically by reneging on a deal to pump less oil. True, record volumes of crude from its main southern terminals last month tell a slightly different story. But higher oil prices would be better for Baghdad than higher volumes."
Trump hopes partial shutdown of government will not last long,"Nuclear energy is having an economic meltdown. Entergy, a $13 billion company, just agreed to close a plant 30 miles north of New York City, blaming the low cost of natural gas. More operators are bound to follow suit."
Factbox: Outgoing Pentagon chief Mattis was often at odds with Trump,"Japanese companies' overseas shopping sprees tend to be overpriced. Takeda Pharmaceutical is the latest acquirer to pay over the odds. The $34 billion drugmaker is shelling out $5.2 billion, a 75 percent premium, for Ariad Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company with a middling cancer drug."
Labour’s risky UK manifesto requires Brexit context,"If specialness were a tradable commodity, the United Kingdom would be deep in deficit to the United States. As Britain moves closer to a clean break with its main trading partners in the European Union, the so-called special relationship with its transatlantic ally, which accounted for over 160 billion pounds of commerce in 2015, is even more important. With the United States under new management and Britain’s global role in flux, it is also vulnerable."
EasyJet gives lesson in counter-cyclical aviation,Global banks are being hit by Southeast Asia’s distrust of hot money. Indonesia plans to introduce new rules to ensure research about the health of its economy and financial markets is “factual”. It follows a decision by Jakarta to cut business ties with JPMorgan. Meanwhile Malaysia has been clamping down on currency trading. The skittishness moves serve to highlight the region's vulnerabilities ahead of its impressive growth profile.
GIC’s humbling retreat from UBS makes sense,"Britain's war on graft is in danger of falling at the first hurdle. At last May's landmark anti-corruption summit in London, the government headed by then-Prime Minister David Cameron said it would present an anti-corruption strategy by the end of the year. But it didn't. The missed deadline potentially says something unsettling about Britain's post-Brexit priorities."
Thermo Fisher experiment starts with pricey deal,It's past time for Japan to tackle overwork. The 2015 suicide of a 24-year-old who had recently joined Dentsu prompted the advertising giant's president to resign last week. The episode casts a fresh spotlight on the widespread problem of punishingly long hours.
WannaCry exposes glitch in tech business model,"Jeff Bezos may be holding a Trump card in the U.S. retail-store slump. Amazon.com, the e-commerce giant he runs, is considering a bid for the bankrupt American Apparel, according to a Reuters exclusive, just as Macy's and other department stores are losing sales and cutting staff. A deal could be a handy way to show a president-elect suspicious of Silicon Valley that he's saving thousands of working-class U.S. jobs."
Britain gears up for immigration self-harm,"A U.S. federal judge on Sunday denied a motion by George Papadopoulos, a former aide for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, seeking to postpone his sentence pending a separate case he hoped would lead to his conviction being overturned."

China's dealmakers edge out Trump in first round,"Blackstone is going long music. For its first venture into buying and holding companies for extended periods of time, the private-equity firm is taking over SESAC, a group that manages song rights for the likes of Bob Dylan and Mariah Carey. The growth of streaming provides a steady outlook. With some financial improvisation, it's easy to compose a healthy return."
France makes life too easy for pushy bosses,"It’s not easy being a private equity manager. Stock prices are elevated, and debt markets are only willing to lend so much on deals, as regulators limit banks’ risk appetite. Even so, buyout firms are still finding new ways to sweeten returns."
Hong Kong bourse better off without Beijing's aid,"Fidelity International will be the first foreign asset manager to wade into China's brutal domestic market. A licence from Asset Management Association of China lets it raise funds from Chinese institutions and wealthy individuals and invest them onshore. This is a strategic win, but it's no big concession."
"Senator Graham calls for hearings on troops in Syria, Afghanistan","Among UK retailers, Next has tended to give some of the most cautious guidance. This year, that looks the right approach. The clothing chain predicts a particularly doom-laden year for the British high street and warned pre-tax profit may fall by as much as 14 percent. That's down to Next's own issues, but also spiraling costs for retailers. Britons' more ready embrace of online than consumers in some other markets adds to the crunch."
Senate starts vote on whether to take up House-passed funding bill,"Monte dei Paschi's rescue has hit Europe's new regime for rescuing banks where it hurts. The Italian state will fund three-quarters of MPS's 8.8 billion euro rescue, rather than winding it down. The rub is that it's hard to think of a bank that looks more like a candidate for resolution."
Republican U.S. senators: Talks under way on government funding compromise,"Chinese bond investors are finding that trouble comes in threes. First a U.S. rate hike, then a squeeze on short-term lending that dried up fixed-income liquidity, and finally a scandal at a brokerage which fuelled fears about wobbly leverage underpinning China's bond market rally."
Viewsroom: Comey ouster bad for business,Gene therapy is about ready to be the next big thing. The prospect of treating diseases by tinkering with DNA has a long history of both promise and frustration. Steady progress means 2017 should be the year the technology finally hits the U.S. market. The problem may be figuring out how to pay for cures.
Cox: Nixon nostalgia missing from stock market,"For ageing monarchs in the Gulf, handing more power to a younger generation of princes makes sense. The task of diversifying their economies away from dependence on oil exports and implementing tricky social reforms requires an infusion of vigour and fresh ideas. Expect a new breed of millennial royalty and technocrats to emerge in 2017."
"If Britain cools on markets, others lose too","The world faces 2017 all shook up. After the electoral upsets that kicked off with Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and culminated in Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential race, governments, companies and investors are confronted with uncertain and unfamiliar terrain."

Time may join ranks of regretful M&A refuseniks,"Breakingviews columnists from Europe, Asia and the United States discuss what's ahead, including Donald Trump and inequality, how smaller M&A deals will shine over big acquisitions, and why Disney may ponder buying Netflix. Plus, what we got right - and wrong - about 2016."
Standard Life’s honey pot is a shrinking prize,Walt Disney may be looking for a bit of two-for-one magic. The $160 billion entertainment conglomerate is on the hunt for technology to connect consumers directly with its movies and TV shows. It's also in need of a successor to Chief Executive Bob Iger. A Netflix acquisition including founder Reed Hastings might just answer both dreams - though it would be pricey.
Levy takes some sheen off Australian banks,"The pharmaceutical industry's middlemen face a 2017 clampdown. The U.S. medical system's opacity and complexity have stoked drug prices, fueling the flow of dollars to insurers, wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The growth of high-deductible insurance - primed to accelerate under the incoming Trump administration - will bring much-needed transparency to the market, and unaccustomed pressure on these firms."
Moon win offers South Korea ray of sunlight,"The Dominican Republic's beneficial perfect storm won't keep blowing forever. The Caribbean nation of 10 million has notched the strongest economic growth in the Western Hemisphere for the third year running - over 6 percent for 2016, according to U.N. estimates. President Danilo Medina, who cruised to a second term in May with over 60 percent of the vote, has made the most of the favorable climate."
Britain’s Brexit bill is worth the money,Education could be the big trade of 2017 for investment banks. No European city has as many international school places as London. That's a problem for firms thinking of shifting staff out of the UK capital following the referendum to quit the European Union. The solution is for banks to get into the education business themselves.
U.S. appeals court grants Trump request for halt to emoluments case,"India's banks need a cash injection, and 2017 looks like the year that they will get it. The country reckons ailing state lenders need at least 1.8 trillion rupees ($27 billion) or more to shore up their balance sheets and meet global capital requirements. Now Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have a way to rally political support for such a move. "
North Carolina NAACP sues to stop Republican-backed voter ID law,"Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency on a pledge to fix a system rigged against the middle and working class. Over time, maybe he will. But in 2017, look for wealth and income inequality to widen. Though pitchforks lifted the real-estate developer to the White House, the irony is that his proposed economic policies look set to immediately help rich folks the most."
Senate Democratic leader Schumer: House funding bill will not pass Senate,"Succession planning is a big deal at most public companies. For the first time in 124 years, General Electric's may be determined by dealmaking. As Jeff Immelt nears retirement, the progress of two large acquisitions in the coming year will help guide GE's board on who should get the top job."
What's Britain's real Brexit bill?,"In November 2015, Mark Carney signalled the end of “too big to fail”. Globally harmonised regulation centred on new-fangled “bail-in” innovations would allow megabanks to collapse without ruining their host countries, the Bank of England boss said proudly. Yet the rules keep coming, and cross-border cohesion is splintering. In 2017, the twin imperatives of being safe and efficient will get even further apart.    Following the 2008 financial crisis, a legitimate r"

Coach pays luxury price to catch up with LVMH,"South Korea's national pension giant is being put on a leash after prosecutors detained its chairman in a corruption probe. The case highlights how the country's biggest investor, with more than $450 billion under management - including sizable stakes in the biggest companies in the country - could be manipulated at the expense of other shareholders. Korea could use a safeguard."
Sinclair $3.9 bln Tribune deal puts Fox in a hole,"Saudi Arabia's oil producer, Aramco, is its crown jewel. And jewels ought not to be given away too freely. The company's initial public offering was meant to be the centrepiece of a new economic strategy designed to wean the country off its dependence on crude oil exports. But rising oil prices could make that financially less necessary, especially since Aramco is fraught with political sensitivity."
Macron has bigger fish to fry than Brexit,American companies will give new meaning to cash flow in 2017. The chances of sharply lower U.S. corporate tax rates have gone up with Republicans in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Such a change would probably lead to a tide of dollars coming home.
Australian media buyout might need an edit,"Venezuela's economy is a wreck, but the Bolivarian revolution's inept leader, President Nicolas Maduro, has probably done just enough to avoid being forced from office in 2017, unless by Chavista colleagues. A bond swap and army-led food distribution helped. But his gutting of institutions risks violence that may yet be his undoing."
Macron may change France in unintended ways,"Like democracy and the Cold War, European populism after the financial crisis had its origins in Greece. The leftist Syriza party swept to victory in January 2015 promising to dismantle the elite, thumb its nose at European creditors and restore prosperity through radically worker-friendly policies."
Buffett's praise of Jack Bogle sounds self-serving,Toshiba still doesn't have a grip on its sprawl. The $14 billion technology-to-construction conglomerate may take another multibillion-dollar writedown at its nuclear-power business. That will further weaken the indebted Japanese group's balance sheet – and it reignites fears about management's control.
Dan Loeb’s Honeywell spin goes too far,"Interest-rate hikes will help America's underfunded public pensions in 2017. Relief could be fleeting, however, especially if the U.S. economy falters. Illinois and Dallas, in particular, are canaries in a $1 trillion coal mine."
Review: Can we avoid another financial crisis?,Wal-Mart Stores' tortoise-like digital pace may yet pay off. The $218 billion retailer is making some strides with its e-commerce efforts as sales increase. August's $3 bln purchase of Jet.com will accelerate the push to compete with Amazon. Patchy customer service and a brick-and-mortar image are some of the remaining hurdles to the plodding retailer's online success.
Acting U.S. attorney general declines to recuse himself from Russia probe: source,"Harry Potter's upcoming 20th birthday is a good occasion to add some magic to predictive power. It's a well-worn tale that, before the boy wizard first hit British bookshelves on June 26, 1997, author J.K. Rowling was turned away by dozens of agents and publishers who couldn't see the value of investing in such a fantastical yarn. Similarly closed minds help explain why recent political upheavals have surprised many and economic outlooks are so often wrong. A l"
Republicans in House to try adding border wall to short-term funding bill,"The romance between Donald Trump and his conservative allies may founder over the future of the Export-Import Bank once he takes office. The president-elect's ""America First"" approach to industrial policy should be good news for the government credit agency that finances foreign purchases of U.S. goods. But it has been hobbled by Republicans who deride it as corporate welfare."
Trump says any measure that funds U.S. government must include border security,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will not destroy the global economy by being tough on Saudi Arabia over the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, although the CIA believes Khashoggi's murder was ordered by that country's crown prince."
Greek bonds are the last of the ECB free rides,"European lenders' end-of-year fines for mortgage mis-selling have confounded market expectations and left a clear winner: Deutsche Bank. Although Britain's Barclays failed to achieve similar closure, Germany's largest lender by assets and peer Credit Suisse's agreed settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice remove a major question mark."
Macau keeps gambling on gambling,"Monte dei Paschi's rescue is a bailout masquerading as a bail-in. European rules now mean governments that save banks have to force losses on creditors, or convert them into shares. Italy is doing that with MPS, but adding an unjustified bit of financial engineering that makes it no better than bank bailouts from 2008."
Viewsroom: Apple starts iPhone birthday bash early,"The plot should improve for China's silver screen in 2017. Ticket sales are on track to grow at their slowest pace in a decade in 2016, to a bit more than $6 billion. The picture could then brighten as a promising slate of films wins back moviegoers and investors."
Cox: Tech monopolies crowding out little guys,"Will Uber Technologies ever make money? The ride-share giant's recent exit from the cutthroat Chinese market should help, but it may still lose $2.8 billion in EBITDA this year, according to figures reported by The Information on Dec. 19. Economic theory suggests Uber is handing its passengers lots of value. Turning a profit for investors, though, is a different story."
London could trip on Aramco's IPO red carpet,"Latin America's rightward turn will face serious tests in the next few months. Several countries in the region have shunned leftist populism of late as a reaction to leaders' economic ineptitude. But if their pro-business successors deliver all the pain of austerity without decent growth, they'll face renewed opposition, whether at the ballot box or on the streets."
Next iPhone is key to Apple's future in China,"Monte dei Paschi has one foot in the grave, but there are still good and bad ways to proceed. Italy's third-biggest bank failed to fill a 5 billion euro regulatory hole and is now set to convert debt into equity, keeping government money to a minimum. The trick is to limit compensation to those private creditors that deserve it."
Even yellow flags can’t dent Facebook’s growth,"Evergrande's M&A boldness has backfired. China's second biggest property developer has spent 36.3 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) building a stake of more than 14 percent in larger rival Vanke. With the regulator cracking down on capital market ""savages"" and Evergrande itself now ruling out a takeover, the bet is 13 percent out of the money - and things could get worse."
Tesla demonstrates valuation staying power,"As the most recent merger boom winds down, the broken promises of over-eager corporate executives will begin to emerge in earnest. Contrary to the Wall Street spin, one plus one rarely amounts to more than two. The progress of three transactions from the start of the current cycle illustrates the ways investors will be let down in 2017."
French savers are a good bulwark against Le Pen,"What will be the top financial merger of 2017? Will it be UniCredit buying Deutsche Bank, or Bank of China swooping on JPMorgan? Think again. It will be America's two markets watchdogs – the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – crunching into one über-regulator."
Apple plays soothing iPhone hold music,"Mediaset shares may be on the up bit of a big dipper. Silvio Berlusconi's group has soared in value on hopes of a takeover by Vivendi, controlled by Vincent Bollore. The French tycoon may still unlock a breakup value higher than the current share price. Yet the lack of clarity over his objectives means shareholders' ride could get rockier."
US also seen ending air war against Islamic State in Syria: officials,"President Donald Trump is likely to give U.S. troops authority to protect immigration agents stationed along the U.S. border with Mexico if they come under threat from migrants seeking to cross into the United States, a U.S. official said on Monday."
Pelosi reiterates opposition to border wall funds in U.S. spending bill,"China's global push has gone a bit soggy with Weetabix. Bright Food may sell the British cereal-maker at a disappointing-looking valuation of about 1 billion pounds ($1.2 billion), Reuters says, citing three sources. This foreign foray offers a cautionary tale: buying a business is the easy part, and Western products don't always suit Chinese tastes."
"Trump to meet lawmakers, weighing options on shutdown as deadline looms","Uber Technologies could encounter a bumpy ride into public markets. The ride-hailing service has spent the past several years racking up impressive growth. It also has raised easily at least $15 billion, in the process inflating its value to some $68 billion on paper. That will make the next round, possibly in a 2017 initial public offering, tougher."
ConocoPhillips is wasting its oil crisis,"The backlash against globalization misses the real danger to jobs in 2017: robots. Voters are rewarding nativist politicians. But campaign promises to bring back manufacturing jobs will soon prove hollow. That's because the bogeyman is automation, not open borders."
U.S. air-traffic revamp is overdue for boarding,Financial conditions for mega-mergers are excellent. The chances of getting them done are terrible. That's a good thing.      Nearly $850 billion of combinations worth at least $10 billion apiece announced since the beginning of 2015 were waiting to close as of Dec. 1. Among them: Dow Chemical's $130 billion merger with DuPont and AT&T's $85 billion bid for Time Warner.     Some won't get past trustbusters. Efforts to merge four huge U.S. health insurers into two
ConocoPhillips is wasting its oil crisis,"Nintendo is a puzzle for the market. Disappointment over ""Super Mario Run"", an important push into mobile gaming, has sent the Japanese company's shares on a round-trip. Making a successful leap to this new on-the-move platform is critical for Nintendo - but investors are struggling to decode what they have seen so far."
Barclays chief learns silence is golden,"Ireland and Apple's tax tussle with the European Commission could be the last big case of its kind, if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's desire to let domestic companies repatriate cash is more than a one-off. Dublin on Monday appealed commission demands for the U.S. tech giant to pay the country 13 billion euros ($13.6 billion) in back taxes, saying it had misapplied state aid rules and was confused about international tax law. Senior Apple executives told Reu"
BP is pumping its way out of trouble,"Ukraine’s bank clean-up comes at a cost. The war-torn country will rescue the largest private lender PrivatBank. It suggests Ukraine’s banks are emerging from the grip of oligarchs and bad lending. Yet the deal hurts Ukraine’s already shaky finances, and may inflame political tensions."
TV deal stirs ghosts of erratic Murdoch past,"CalPERS may be getting a bit more real. The $300 billion California public employees' pension manager is considering cutting its investment-return assumption. The move would squeeze the budgets of public authorities and employees but secure funding for retirees. If the U.S. government-pension bellwether can do it, others will follow."

Henry Kravis finds polite barbarian at his gate,"Russia lacks the motive and the money to repair the damage in Syria. The imminent collapse of rebel forces in Aleppo, the Middle Eastern state's largest city, has been hastened by the involvement on the government side of Russia and Iran.

U.S. Senate OKs government funding through February 8 to avert shutdown,"The Brazilian billionaires at 3G Capital that turned Kraft Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev into mega-acquisition machines will dive back into the buying business in the coming year. Their next target should be Mondelez, the $66 billion food conglomerate that failed to coax chocolate-maker Hershey into a sale in 2016. A deal will require some unusual ingredients."
U.S. imposes fresh Russia sanctions for election meddling,"On the third floor of the National Palace Museum in Taiwan, visitors queue for half an hour to see a head of cabbage carved in green and white jadeite.

MSCI’s China plan is clever window dressing,"Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, is well versed in international dealmaking. But he's too close to Russia even for some Senate Republicans. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs shuffles the top ranks and Wells Fargo's regulatory hubris comes back to bite."

Cox: Proximity to Trump no blessing for stocks,"Sky’s shareholders can’t fly much higher. Some of the UK pay-TV group’s investors are grumbling that independent directors gave in too quickly to an opportunistic bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox. But the market had previously given Sky the thumbs-down, and the premium looks generous. A small sweetener is the best investors can hope for."
Lloyds hits peak Horta-Osorio,"Hong Kong has modestly burnished its financial-centre credentials with beauty-app Meitu's $629 million listing, the biggest tech deal in a decade. Other Chinese entrepreneurs are watching intently. But Hong Kong's lacklustre aftermarket may still send mainland unicorns galloping to New York."
Samsung's choice of Plan A doesn't quite add up,"Hertz Global's new chief executive faces a tough drive out of the ditch. Kathryn Marinello has a great résumé. The problem is that she's the $2 billion rental-car outfit's third boss in two years - and activist investor Carl Icahn is in the back seat, fidgeting with a 35 percent stake. Moreover, the company's engine is sputtering, despite her predecessor's attempts to get it firing more smoothly."
Twitter unduly attracts financial followers,"Exxon Mobil's next chief executive will confront a weakened empire in 2017. With current boss Rex Tillerson selected as Donald Trump's secretary of state, likely successor Darren Woods will take charge of the $380 billion oil giant amid still-weak prices and falling reserves."

Credit Suisse's Thiam picks capital over returns,"The biggest challenge for Deutsche Boerse's merger with the London Stock Exchange might lie not in Brussels but closer to home. Antitrust regulators in the European Union's de-facto capital have limited the scope of their competition probe into the effect on derivatives clearing, and the companies have already offered to sell some businesses in Paris to alleviate concerns. In Deutsche Boerse's home state of Hesse, regulators may be harder to please."
Add Wells Fargo chairman to fake-accounts firings,"A counterbid in Australian gambling looks like a long shot. A buyout team has gatecrashed the friendly tie-up of Tabcorp and Tatts, which is meant to create a near-$9 billion giant managing lotteries and pool-based ""tote"" betting across Australia. The new approach for Tatts is fiddlier and the valuation is rather slippery. Still, the target’s board should be able to use this to wring a bit more out of Tabcorp."
Credit Suisse's Thiam picks capital over returns,"Tax evaders are spoiling Prime Minister Narendra Modi's play for the history books with his fight against illicit wealth.

Factbox: Blocked subpoenas suggest House Democrats' probe targets,"UniCredit's revamp is a key moment in Italy's bank crisis. A cost cull, bad debt purge and mega-cash call mean the country's biggest bank should soon be less of a worry. With Rome facing a volatile 2017, it's just as well."
Trump signed off on Moscow project during campaign: Giuliani,The Redstones do like to keep everyone on their toes. The family that controls media firms CBS and Viacom on Monday nixed their proposal for the companies to merge. The Murdochs' bid for Sky and AT&T's deal for Time Warner have ignited the industry's animal spirits. That has raised the prospect that reuniting the two media firms would rob CBS of a better offer.
Exclusive: U.S. to offer 'black box' nuclear waste tech to other nations,"Italy's next prime minister is a five star gift for populists. Paolo Gentiloni has to fix the banks, sort out voting rules and steer the country to elections. A replacement for Matteo Renzi is better than a vacuum. But given Gentiloni is from the same europhile Democratic Party, doing too good a job might increase the chances of the populist, eurosceptic 5-Star Movement taking power."
Toshiba axing PwC would be ugly bid to stay listed,"Talk about an impossible job. Hong Kong needs a competent, charismatic leader to reassure a rattled finance industry, tame crazed property prices and make peace with a protest movement. The ideal candidate won't look like Beijing's pawn, while being precisely that. Nor can the candidate be a tool of the tycoons, although without their support election is impossible."
Tyson makes shareholders tasty $3.2 bln sandwich,"The Murdochs are having another shot at Sky. Twenty-First Century Fox has offered to buy the 61 percent of the European pay-TV group it doesn't own. The proposal notionally values Sky at 18.5 billion pounds, though only about 11.3 billion pounds would change hands. Circumstances look a lot more auspicious than the last time Rupert Murdoch and his family tried to consolidate the business in 2010."
Trump finds a trade battle worth fighting,The U.S. president-elect upended decades of diplomacy by taking a call from Taiwan's leader. But some U.S. companies will welcome his stance. And China has much to lose from any escalation. Also: Italy PM Renzi gets his marching orders. And there's no easy move to monetize chess.
Theresa May channels Margaret Thatcher in reverse,Rome and Brussels will have to get tough if they want to save Monte dei Paschi. The Sienese lender has been a serial pest on the European regulatory scene for almost a decade. Italy is devising increasingly quixotic attempts to prevent small investors in the bank from taking losses. Realism is needed.
IPO delay lifts spotlight off China's shadow banks,"Hackers linked to the Russian government are impersonating U.S. State Department employees in an operation aimed at infecting computers of U.S. government agencies, think tanks and businesses, two cybersecurity firms told Reuters."
Lackluster $24 bln medical merger better than none,"Capitalism takes many guises around the world. In Italy, it has a family twist. In France, the state plays a starring role. Japan tries to achieve consensus with government, conglomerates, salarymen and society at large. China's Communist Party dubs it socialism with Chinese characteristics. In Germany, labor gets a voice. America's model puts the stockholders of public companies front and center. Until now."
European market reboot depends on more than Macron,"A spate of corporate deal remorse has left investors regretful, too. Abbott Laboratories on Wednesday cited ""material adverse events"" in a legal bid to end its $5.8 billion takeover of medical-test maker Alere. Similar tensions have arisen in mergers involving Yahoo, Williams and Cigna. They all help make the case for heightened shareholder skepticism."
"Taiwan, not China, is its own worst enemy",Matteo Renzi gambled with the electorate and lost. Italy’s prime minister resigned on Wednesday after losing a referendum on political reforms. Yet that may not be the end. A quick election could bring him back.
Markets are wary of new blot on Japan Inc's image,"China will still be on the menu for McDonald's. The $100 billion U.S. burger giant is poised to sell its outlets in mainland China and Hong Kong for up to $2 billion. Seeing this as a simple retreat from the Middle Kingdom is tempting, but wrong. As elsewhere, franchising is a better business than owning and operating stores. There are other benefits to having a Chinese partner too."
Winning French presidency is easy part for Macron,"The success of Linde’s new chief executive, Aldo Belloni, will be measured by an unusual yardstick: whether he can make himself redundant. The German industrial gases group on Wednesday hauled the 66-year-old out of retirement to secure a $65 billion merger with U.S. rival Praxair."
"Trump willing to look at extraditing Turkish cleric, but noncommittal",What happens in France might not stay in France. But the fact that it might happen at all is now being reflected in the bond market.
"Trump pressures Fed before meeting, warns against 'another mistake'","Spending tens of billions of dollars in the United States should be a cinch for SoftBank. The Japanese group's founder, Masayoshi Son, on Tuesday promised Donald Trump he would invest $50 billion in the country, creating one job for every million dollars spent. The pledge may even help curry favour for the businessman's long-sought merger of his U.S. telecoms business with a rival. Creating 50,000 jobs in the thinly staffed tech industry, though, will be difficult."
Trump bans 'bump stocks' used in Las Vegas mass shooting,"JBS sharpened its carve-up blade. The $8 billion Brazilian meatpacker filed on Monday to list its overseas business again after a government shareholder nixed an earlier plan that could have put the Sao Paulo-based rump under control of a foreign parent. The new deal should lower capital costs, but with fewer complications."
Markets back Dimon not Kashkari on too-big-to-fail,Greece’s deal with its creditors makes it look a bit less like Sisyphus. But it still resembles a highly challenged Hercules.
White House sends new mixed message to Wall Street,"Fosun's sale of U.S. insurer Ironshore shows one of China's most aggressive dealmakers knows how to get out while the going is good. The $3 billion sale to Liberty Mutual will help Fosun slim down and sharpen its focus on emerging markets. As president-elect Donald Trump's team steps up its China-bashing, the U.S. will only become harder for mainland firms to navigate."
Review: Lessons from ghosts of tax reform past,Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday seeking to strike back at Saudi Arabia over the death of a Saudi journalist at a consulate in Turkey and for its role in Yemen's devastating civil war.
Tech fund overflow may swamp deal discipline,The UK's Brexit drama in the Supreme Court is a sideshow. The country's highest legal authority is this week hearing the government's appeal against a ruling that it must give parliament a vote before triggering a European Union exit. Two separate but related legal matters - over membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and whether the EU exit process can be reversed - may be more significant.
How tech pushed finance into a status crisis,"Cleaning up Italy's banks is an opportunity ripe for the wasting. The failed referendum on Senate reform on Dec. 4 need not cause a crisis if UniCredit completes its rights issue and fellow lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) can be quickly stabilised. Political turmoil and weak growth, though, could push up bad loan levels, and political will to fix them may be lacking."
Viewsroom: Theresa May’s big Brexit gamble,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's precedent-breaking call with Taiwan's president on Dec. 2, followed by ominous tweets about Chinese policy and American firms' overseas production, has policy wonks scratching their heads. But one message is clear. Trump is indifferent to any potential backlash against U.S. investments in China, and may even welcome it."
Cox: Ugly global paint battle drips with irony,"The president-elect brought in a rare bipartisan player as Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin and saved 1,000 jobs in Indiana.

Belated O’Reilly exit shows Fox still on back foot,"- South Korea's dislike of cash is now official. The country wants to go coinless by 2020. For one of the most wired nations in the world where electronic payments are already commonplace, it is an achievable target. Asia's latest currency experiment can also offer valuable lessons for a region hooked on ready money. "
Economic heresy is real winner in French election,"Europe is in for a tense long weekend. In the space of 48 hours starting on Sunday, Italy's premier will face a make-or-break referendum, Austria could elect a far-right president, and Greek debt talks will reach a head. All three events have the power to revive the centrifugal forces that could send Europe spinning out of control."
U.S. Cuba lobby celebrates a farm bill win despite worsening ties,"China has moved a step closer to investing $290 billion worth of public pension funds in financial markets, including stocks. That's a small step in the right direction of adding institutional investor gravitas to an erratic market, but more needs to be done to ensure comfortable retirement for China's rapidly aging workforce."
"After reports, Trump turns eye to his own social media followers","Steven Mnuchin will have to get his own finances in order before he can focus on the nation's. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Treasury Department has made millions on Wall Street. Unlike his new boss, Mnuchin will have to produce his tax returns to win congressional approval, a step that has tripped up past nominees."
Factbox: Mueller and other probes posing risk for Trump,"President-elect Donald Trump has made an illogically logical choice for his first U.S. Treasury secretary. Steven Mnuchin's Wall Street past will rankle Democrats. But unlike many Trump has put on his team, he is neither an ideologue nor a populist. He's also well qualified for the job, bipartisan and relatively reserved.     Mnuchin's career as a financier won't make for a smooth ride though confirmation hearings. He spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, running "
China's Aramco pitch puts pressure on Tokyo's bid,A federal judge on Thursday refused to dismiss criminal charges against a Russian company accused by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller of funding a propaganda operation to sway the 2016 presidential election in Donald Trump’s favor.
James Gorman rubs Goldman Sachs’ nose in it,"Britain's latest stress test has sorted the country's banks into good, bad and ugly. HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group comfortably passed the Bank of England's annual exam on Nov. 30, while Barclays and Standard Chartered did relatively poorly. Royal Bank of Scotland, predictably, was bottom of the class."
IBM's cloud provides little silver lining,"China’s selfie IPO only looks good in a certain light. Meitu wants a valuation of up to $5.2 billion in its Hong Kong initial public offering, the city's biggest tech listing in a decade. The company's user base is growing fast, thanks to photo and video apps that have features like virtual makeup and skin whitening. Any beauty here is skin deep, however."
UK election will test markets’ Brexit optimism,Zimbabwe's new quasi-currency has a trust issue. That's hardly surprising for a country scarred by hyperinflation. Harare's new “bond notes” could help address its epic economic problems – but it’s a big ask.
Australia's Tatts could wring more out of KKR team,Samsung Electronics has set a cautious tone with activist investor Elliott Management. The South Korean conglomerate says it will consider using a holding company structure. It's a measured but welcome response to the U.S. fund's restructuring proposals. Plans to boost dividends and buy back more stock also show the group is serious about improving relations with shareholders.
Goldman fintech revolution can't come fast enough,"Time Inc owners may yet send a note of thanks to Edgar Bronfman Jr. The former Seagram heir teamed up with Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik to make a bid for the $1.4 billion magazine firm - an offer which was rejected, according to the New York Post. The 30 percent mooted premium sounds decent for an indebted publisher with falling sales."
Theresa May cashes in at peak political valuation,"Standard & Poor's faces a classic Catch-22 in deciding whether to downgrade South Africa's sovereign debt. All things being equal, S&P would use a Dec. 2 review to become the first of the three main ratings agencies to cut the emerging market nation's foreign-currency debt to junk status. Yet it will be reluctant to take a step which could make things worse."
Netflix content crown begins to fit comfortably,"China has welcomed foreign fund managers to play in the hottest corner of its volatile equity markets. Unfortunately the government's rhetorical support for ""indigenous innovation"" led to overheated share prices. That and other market distortions should warn off the cautious investor."
Online retailers betray limits of the internet,"Charismatic Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has died aged 90, resembled other paternalistic strongmen of right and left in his outsized ego, which ultimately stymied his people. Cubans, like other Latin Americans, need institutions more than saviors."
Chinese news app gets a sci-fi valuation,"This is the week when all Americans give thanks for the bounties bestowed on them by the Blessed Creator and recall the challenges faced by the Pilgrims when they landed at Cape Cod and relied upon the mercy of the Wampanoag people to survive their first brutal winter. It is also a time to reflect on the cornucopia of riches Donald Trump's rise to the presidency has showered on so many of the offspring of those founders, particularly on the American coasts. Her"
Trump did not tell Erdogan he would extradite Gulen: White House official,"Financial markets are having a retro moment. The prospect of big tax cuts and higher interest rates in the United States have given government bond yields and the dollar a boost. Investors are drawing parallels with the 1980s, when similar policies held sway. There are good reasons, though, to doubt that asset prices will mimic the past."
"Factbox: Trump, U.S. Congress flirt with partial government shutdown","The Justice Department on Wednesday defended the legality of President Donald Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general to replace the ousted Jeff Sessions, rejecting the views of critics that the move ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution and federal law."
Justice Department asks appeals court to end Trump emoluments case,"A gunmaker's stock plunges following the election of a firearm-friendly U.S. president, because a victory for his rival might have sparked a last-minute sales rush. A German bank's shares slump after the country's chancellor reportedly vows not to bail it out. In both cases, new information leads to a significant change in the company's value. And in both, financial accounts would have been no use whatsoever."
Murder video puts lie to Facebook cleanup pledge,"Narendra Modi's gamble will cost India the title of the world's fastest-growing large economy, at least in the short term. That is the result of the prime minister's shock move, announced on Nov. 8, to outlaw 500 and 1,000-rupee notes. That removes almost $250 billion of bills, 86 percent of the currency by value, from circulation. Breakingviews examines the far-reaching consequences."
"Arconic CEO's foolishness saves its board, for now","Anyone who has rented a property knows that efficient markets have their limits. Britain’s government on Nov. 23 proposed a ban on directly charging tenants one-off fees, a move that pulled the rug from under the shares of listed estate agents. It’s an interference with market forces that, nonetheless, will make the market work better."
Viewsroom: United joins corporate culture chaos,"There is a silver lining for investors in a deepening political crisis in South Korea. Popular fury over a scandal involving President Park Geun-hye could give her successor a mandate for sweeping political and corporate changes. For investors, that could mean better governance at the likes of Samsung – and a boost to the valuations of Seoul-listed shares."
M&A code names can be a warning in themselves,"Blackstone's real-estate whiz, Jon Gray, was an unlikely candidate to serve as Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, but his skills may nevertheless be of good use to the president-elect. He is one of the only people able to untangle Trump's towering conflicts of interest in one fell swoop."
U.S. banks all dressed up with few places to grow,"Snap wants to be sure youth is not wasted on the young. The disappearing-message and picture app is preparing an initial public offering at the tender age of five years. That's earlier than most of its technologically minded peers, which tend to mature a little more before going public. Snap's value, however, may yet have some growing to do.    The Los Angeles-based startup led by 26-year-old Evan Spiegel and formerly known as Snapchat submitted confidential IP"
Swede tissue bid justifies breakups without tears,"Britain’s bill for leaving the European Union is becoming clearer - and the government has limited scope to soften the blow. That’s the stark message Chancellor Philip Hammond delivered in his Autumn Statement on Nov. 23. He has given himself some wiggle room, and uncertainty about the outcome of Brexit negotiations means he may need it."
Infosys cash return is a welcome distraction,"Markets are better equipped than voters to deal with a post-truth world. Granted, investors are as liable to fall for the sort of fake news and bogus rumours that are increasingly plaguing politics. The difference is, the truth usually manages to reassert itself pretty quickly in the world of money."
Hadas: Fed leak and Libor lie expose bigger issue,"Things could get ugly for Indian IT firms in the new world order. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump says he will investigate all abuses of visas for skilled foreign workers. His chosen attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is a fierce of critic of the issue too. That suggests the tough pre-election rhetoric on the issue could become reality. "
United fiasco puts a value on the humble apology,"On a recent Friday night after Donald Trump was elected America's 45th president, some students from Wilton High School in Connecticut shouted ""build a wall"" at a football game. Wilton is the seventh-richest town in one of the most affluent states in the Union. Its 18,000 residents also happen to be about 96 percent white."

U.S. Senate report to detail extent of Russian election meddling: Washington Post,Volkswagen’s new strategy for its troubled core passenger brand hits many of the right buttons. Cutting labour costs and favouring the development of electric vehicles over conventional ones are sensible priorities. Yet the gameplan unveiled on Nov. 22 also repeats past errors by placing too much emphasis on how many cars are sold and too little on profitability.
"After outcry over appointment, Trump's top law enforcer treading lightly","Donald Trump is not an intellectual in his investments or his political views. It’s safe to say that the U.S. president-elect’s business decisions were guided by intuition more than by financial theory. The fears and doubts created by Trump’s election success, though, might prompt a much-needed change in a structurally unsound and economically dangerous academic model of reality."
"As Zinke departs, Trump says he will name new interior secretary next week","Donald Trump is not helping Indian prime minister Narendra Modi's effort to call time on crony capitalism. The U.S. president-elect met with Indian developers of Trump Towers Pune in New York last week. Discussions followed with members of the Trump family about possible deals in a market where the Trump Organization has projects worth $1.5 billion, local newspapers reported."
Risk-taking Reliance shows Indian market shift,"Ireland’s gilded age of tax competitiveness may be drawing to a close. UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans to cut the corporate tax rate, and similar pledges across the Atlantic from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, undercut one of Dublin’s key attractions to foreign companies. Further reductions to Ireland’s headline 12.5 percent rate are politically fraught and involve forfeiting an important source of government revenue. That leaves the country more depend"

Tesla shareholders drive off into la-la land,"In a year of global political upheaval, France has delivered its own mini upset. Francois Fillon, a former prime minister, unexpectedly topped the first round of the opposition centre-right’s presidential primaries on Nov. 20.

Cox: Grover Cleveland offers timely trade lesson,"Asian leaders, dismayed by American disarray on free trade, are warming up to ""China-led"" alternatives to the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). But Beijing says it doesn't want a leadership role forging the new pacts necessary to reinvigorate regional trade. It is understandable why China would want to duck the reputational damage TPP's failure is inflicting on the United States, but the world's second largest economy is in a leadership position now wh"

As CEOs, world leaders and investors try to interpret what's in store, a new Breakingviews e-book chronicles Trump the businessman, candidate, populist and president-elect. Who he surrounds himself with is paramount."
Life Down Under is good — maybe too good,"Britain is turning the screw on embattled asset managers. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has criticised weak competition and proposed remedies that could lower earnings and pay. Given the rapid growth of cheaper passive investments, it’s a knock the sector didn’t want but probably needs."
United shows service and shareholders don’t fly,"The Bank of Japan has put its ""yield-curve control"" plan into practice. On Nov. 17 the central bank offered to buy shorter-dated bonds in unlimited amounts, the first time it has wielded the tools it introduced two months ago. This episode hasn't cost the BOJ anything, because the bank offered below-market prices that nobody took up. Even so, it shows how the revamped framework aims to shield Japan from rising global yields."

Indonesian tax amnesty odd help for private banks,"Harvard Business School's dean faces his own moral dilemma. Nitin Nohria essentially wrote the book on ethics and leadership. But he also sits on the board of Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerate at the centre of a corporate governance scandal. The link risks damaging the brand of one of the world's top business schools by suggesting its leaders don't practise the values they charge a fortune to teach."
California could have seismic impact on 2020 Democratic presidential race,"Harvard Business School's dean faces his own moral dilemma. Nitin Nohria essentially wrote the book on ethics and leadership. But he also sits on the board of Tata Sons, the Indian conglomerate at the centre of a corporate governance scandal. The link risks damaging the brand of one of the world's top business schools by suggesting its leaders don't practise the values they charge a fortune to teach."
Trump says budget director Mulvaney to be acting White House chief of staff,"Europe's anti-austerity swerve faces an uphill climb. The European Commission wants euro zone countries to boost spending by 0.5 percent of GDP next year. It's a belated attempt to head off Trump-style anti-establishment revolts on the continent. To make a difference, however, wealthy countries would have to help struggling ones."
"Cohen says Trump knew of hush payments, 'doesn't tell the truth'","Evercore's two chairmen are an enviable problem. Wooing former Goldman Sachs partner John Weinberg is a coup for the $2.9 billion advisory firm. Making him executive chairman, though, muddies governance and creates top-heavy management."
"Spotify considers listing without I, P and O","Saudi Arabia has untapped resources beyond oil. Its women are very slowly wresting freedoms in a society dominated by men, religion and petrol. The kingdom can do as much for its economy by helping more of them enter the workforce as it would if it were able to immediately and sustainably boost the price of a barrel of crude by a couple of dollars."
Trump's Syria strikes don't justify crude worries,"Volkswagen is tweaking its partnerships in China, paving the way to migrate some production of the popular Audi brand out of its joint venture with the decrepit China FAW and into the more dynamic SAIC. FAW may mourn, but the Audi team is most worried about Mercedes Benz, not its local partners. After three decades of policy coddling, Chinese domestic JV brands are still not competing at the Germans' level."
China's Netflix-to-Tesla still awes investors,"Donald Trump may have handed Saudi Arabia an excuse to back out of a shaky pledge to cut oil output. Fears that the U.S. president-elect will supercharge domestic drilling, renege on global climate-change commitments and restore sanctions on Iran mean it is in the kingdom’s best interest to keep the spigots wide open."
Even Cohn-Warren can't bring back Glass-Steagall,"Warren Buffett beats up on few industries with the regularity of American airlines. In a 2007 investor letter, the Sage of Omaha, still smarting from an errant $358 million investment in USAir two decades earlier, called the sector a ""bottomless pit"" for capital. He quipped that investors would've been better served if aviation pioneer Orville Wright had been shot down at Kitty Hawk. Now his Berkshire Hathaway is sinking more than $1.3 billion into the four larg"
Viewsroom: Jamie Dimon’s bank-reform cheat sheet,Russia’s crackdown on its economy minister carries a cost. Alexei Ulyukayev may or may not be guilty of accepting a $2 million bribe - as alleged after he was detained in an early-morning operation on Nov. 15. But it’s less good for the Russian economy if he no longer plays a senior role in government.

Fantasy gaming IPO has real-life charms,"China’s eco-friendly businesses are eager to expand by buying up overseas expertise. The Chinese market for green goods and services is flourishing – partly because of regulations designed to limit pollution – and chasing high-tech, high-profile buys pleases ambitious officials in Beijing. But acquisitions are not always the best way to grow."
Panera buyout overeggs fast-food feeding frenzy,"Samsung is riding a stallion instead of a unicorn into the driverless revolution. Despite no stated cost savings, the 28 percent premium the Korean electronics group agreed to pay for connected-car supplier Harman International is reasonable. The likes of Alphabet's Google are investing heavily to invent the automotive future as General Motors and others bet on risky startups. This deal suggests there are safer ways to play a mega-trend in the making."
Markets snooze their way to Le Pen showdown,"Back in my single days, I considered marrying Naomi Campbell. If word had credibly spread about this supermodel-bride desire, my bachelor credentials would have been huge. And so it is with Donald Trump's transition team. A steady drip of established and competent names trickling out to join the Cabinet gives a veneer of seriousness to the former reality-TV star that has been lacking since he started his presidential bid by calling Mexicans rapists in June 2015"
"U.S. to counter China, Russia influence in Africa: Bolton","Mohamed Alabbar's dream of creating a Middle East rival to Amazon may turn out to be a mirage. The Dubai real estate mogul has teamed up with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund to lead a $1 billion investment in a new online retailer called Noon.com. There are merits to backing e-commerce in a region where most shopping still takes place in giant malls. To justify its unicorn status, however, the venture will have to achieve scale by expanding further afield - "
Trump was at meeting when hush payments were discussed: NBC,"Narendra Modi's banknote recall is becoming a make-or-break moment. India's prime minister is under fire after a move to cancel large-denomination rupee notes amounting to 86 percent of the total outstanding by value. The bold step to fight corruption has left Indians queuing outside bank branches since Wednesday to swap old notes for legal tender, bringing parts of the nation's economy to a standstill."
U.S. Senate hands Trump historic rebuke on Saudi Arabia,"History does not move in neat increments. Sometimes, though, dates are hard to ignore. So it seems fitting that Donald Trump's election as U.S. president was confirmed on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. That day in 1989 marked the symbolic triumph of the liberal, democratic and mostly American-led world order that had ruled a chunk of the globe for the previous half-century. Trump's victory 27 years later marks its demise."
China's auxiliary capital looks like Brasilia,"Donald Trump's election as the next American president risks morphing the era of mega-M&A into bumper breakups by command. The self-described dealmaker has already railed against AT&T's planned $85 bln tie-up with Time Warner, wants to rip apart Comcast-NBC Universal and may have a beef with large banks. Corporate chieftains' imperial ambitions may have to be put on hold."
Fox scandals weaken Murdochs' TV future,"After the U.S. election, Italy’s upcoming referendum is looking like the next anti-establishment conflagration. A “no” may topple Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, boost support for the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, and leave both Italy and Europe weaker."
Iceland needs euro peg like cod needs bicycle,"The incoming commander-in-chief's $1 trln infrastructure pledge has buoyed builders and could even help the Fed. The bank stock rally, though, may lack a solid foundation – and Obamacare could be the election's Brexit analogy. Meanwhile, European political iconoclasts rejoice."
Dixon: Start preparing for fourth Greek bailout,"Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 elections and Republicans held onto a majority in the U.S. Senate, but more than a dozen races remain undecided nearly a week later."
Credit Suisse raid jabs at private bank model,Yahoo is hacking out more wiggle room for Verizon. The beleaguered internet firm waited until the day after the U.S. election to reveal a hacker's July claim to have certain user data. That's when it inked a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant. The latest hit to Yahoo's reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.
Empire-building sets HNA on a risky trajectory,London wants to issue its own work visas - or so says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). The lobby group wants a post-Brexit permit valid only in the capital for roles which can’t easily be filled by UK workers. This is a clever idea that tries to reconcile what’s good for the British economy with a national mood that has become less well disposed towards immigration. It probably won’t fly.
U.S. state insurance watchdogs need EU credibility,"Beijing has an unprecedented – and unexpected – opportunity. The election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president opens the door for greater Chinese influence in Asia at American expense. To take advantage, however, China must share its wealth more widely and treat neighbors more like partners and less like the client states many used to be."
Gordhan exit is dual blow for South African debt,"President-elect Donald Trump has been parsimonious with details about his plans. He talked broadly about fixing roads and bridges, enforcing borders and security, chilling out on regulation - and retaliating against those who don't share his vision. Mr. Market is filling in the blanks."
Review: A flawed compass for post-Brexit Britain,"Donald Trump's surprise election win should bring some welcome relief to banks. A Republican Party in control of Congress also usually appeals to financial markets. The president-elect's erratic positions on other important issues, however, could turn those short-term gains into long-term pain."
India bank bailout needs to clear two big hurdles,Vladimir Putin has been handed what can only be described as a trump card. The election of Donald Trump as the United States' 45th president leaves a host of key eastern European policy issues more favourable to his Russian counterpart. The question is what scope Putin has to capitalise on them.
Republicans introduce resolution blaming Saudi prince in journalist death,"Donald Trump could wind up the very embodiment of the isolationist ideals that helped get him elected president of the United States. The reality-TV star began his run over 500 days ago with a ride down an escalator at his eponymous New York tower and completed it with an unlikely ascent early on Wednesday into the White House. In winning over a majority of the electorate, he alienated nearly everyone in a public or private position of power."
No Trump-Putin meeting while Russia holds Ukraine ships: Bolton,"A disastrous quarter for Valeant Pharmaceuticals represents a bad sign of things to come for a whole industry. The embattled company again slashed its profit forecast, this time to below the lower end of a previous range. Some problems are specific to Valeant. Intensifying pressure stands to upend business models heavily dependent on raising prices."
Trump denies ties to ex-lawyer Cohen's crimes,"Larry Ellison has stored some hardball M&A tactics in the cloud. Oracle's founder has won his $9.3 billion battle for NetSuite, even though T. Rowe Price, the seller's biggest independent investor, made a strong case for a higher offer. Fear that Oracle would walk cowed shareholders - a reminder to prospective targets that Ellison takes no prisoners."
Cowen’s China play involves more than just money,Politics in 2016 is forcing investors to rethink old divisions between developed and emerging markets. Money managers used to assume that rich economies were more stable than poorer ones. A turbulent U.S. presidential election and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union have challenged that belief. Greater political volatility will lead to bigger swings in once-safe assets.

Cox: Sears may leave an even bigger finance legacy,"Too much good news from the United States is bad for the yuan. Markets have priced in one rate hike by the Federal Reserve, but positive surprises leading to more increases will undermine China's gradual depreciation of its currency. That could force regulators to tighten up capital controls.   "
Lloyd's exemplifies London's phantom Brexodus,"Larry Ellison has stored some hardball M&A tactics in the cloud. Oracle's  founder has won his $9.3 billion battle for NetSuite , even though T. Rowe Price , the seller's biggest independent investor, made a strong case for a higher offer. Fear that Oracle would walk cowed shareholders - a reminder to prospective targets that Ellison takes no prisoners."
Crisis can make South Korea great again,"Donald Trump promised recently that America's presidential election would be like ""Brexit times five."" The Republican contender means that he would, like the British referendum to leave the European Union, defy polls and emerge victorious. An unexpected win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, who leads in most pre-election surveys of voters, would have a similar effect on U.S. equities as Britain's EU withdrawal did: send them into a downward spiral."
Market's vision of Brexit is too rosy,"Hans Dieter Poetsch was the wrong choice as Volkswagen chairman from day one. His investigation by criminal prosecutors looking into potential market manipulation is really just a reminder that the German carmaker cannot turn a corner until it has made a clean break with its murky past. For that to happen, Poetsch needs to go."
Tencent drifts off course with Tesla,"Hong Kong's new stamp duty only offers a breather for the city's property bubble. The special administrative region has nearly doubled its tax on real-estate sales to 15 percent across the board in the hope of cooling surging prices. It's the toughest measure yet, but continued capital inflows from China will blunt the impact."
Saudi finds cheap way to be generous to Aramco,"An antitrust probe is the caboose of the drug consolidation train. U.S. prosecutors are investigating Mylan, Allergan and others for colluding over generic-medicine prices. Lawmakers are on the case, too. But seeming cooperation on raising the cost to consumers may simply be the natural consequence of a big reduction in competition."
"Tesco has three issues, but only one matters","Investors are keeping faith with Britain. Though benchmark sovereign bond yields have climbed in the past month, this is largely explained by rising inflation expectations and fading hopes that Bank of England Governor Mark Carney might ease policy further. This leaves money managers with few buffers against big political missteps by Prime Minister Theresa May's government."
China’s growing corporate-bank nexus is toxic mix,"Hong Kong regulators should shrug off the latest salvo from Alibaba founder Jack Ma. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Ma warned he might list the $60 billion Ant Financial elsewhere if Hong Kong can't embrace ""innovation"". Creativity is all well and good, but Hong Kong can still innovate without damaging shareholder democracy."
Canada warns U.S. not to politicize extradition cases,"Americans aren't just voting for the 45th president. House and Senate elections affect everything from Wall Street to the Supreme Court.

Trump ex-lawyer Cohen given three years in prison as risks rise for Trump,"Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam recently described Europe's banks as ""uninvestable"". The Swiss bank's third-quarter results make it look like one of them. By keeping its total expenses from rising only slightly, the Swiss bank squeezed out earnings of 41 million Swiss francs ($42 million), well ahead of expectations from analysts polled by Reuters, who expected a 120-million Swiss franc loss. Yet profitability is under pressure in Credit Suisse's weal"

Hong Kong’s first female chief starts from behind,"Support for Donald Trump is thin on Wall Street. One exception is SkyBridge fund chief Anthony Scaramucci, now an economic adviser to the Republican candidate. Scaramucci explains why he's with Trump, and how it has affected his profile among the financial community."
Credit Suisse CEO payout is undeserved,"Seoul is in the grip of a ""shamanistic"" scandal. A row over a quirky confidante is buffeting President Park Geun-hye, prompting her on Nov. 2 to replace both her finance minister and prime minister. The depressing regularity with which such debacles rock South Korean business and politics highlights a problem with dodgy governance. But that is merely one aspect of a larger challenge: avoiding Japanese-style stagnation."
EU birthday party is moment to switch lanes,"Britain's divorce from the European Union has become more complicated. The High Court for England and Wales ruled on Nov. 3 that Prime Minister Theresa May needs parliament's approval to trigger the start of the exit process. Judges decided that rights Britons enjoy courtesy of the EU laws which have been adopted by the UK parliament cannot be signed away by the prime minister, even though she has the power to sign international treaties. The judgment was a setba"
Markets would miss Japan's reformer-in-chief,Credit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam is clearly frustrated with the investment banking operations of the institution he oversees. And with good reason: Wall Street banks seem to have mostly won the battle for supremacy over who gets the lion's share of the fees the world's biggest corporations and investment managers pay to bankers and traders.
"Amazon's Souq buy is cheap, curious trinket","If Angela Merkel is cooling on climate change, the world is in trouble. The German chancellor has been a formidable force in the fight against man-made global warming. In 2015 she pushed the leaders of the G7, a rich-country club, into a historic pledge to stop using fossil fuels by the end of this century. Later that year, she helped to broker the Paris agreement to limit the global temperature rise to below two degrees."
"Viewsroom: Google, Facebook under the gun","Standard Chartered and UBS both just revealed investigations by the Hong Kong regulator. Dodgy initial public offerings are the problem. The 2009 float of China Forestry is common to both probes, according to news reports – the two banks jointly sponsored the issue. If that's the pace of justice, there are dozens more stock zombies that could yet lash out at bankers."
Next takes fashion tips from financial world,"Gannett stopped the presses on its takeover bid for rival Tronc and in the process put a new era for newspaper moguls above the fold. The deal to combine the publishers of USA Today and the Los Angeles Times would have helped reduce costs amid a relentless downturn. Necessary business-model experimentation, however, works best away from the public markets."
Life is looking up for China's insurance giants,"Saudi Arabia’s appointment of a new finance minister reflects the direction of the kingdom’s economy: more joined-up, and with more power in the hands of its young deputy crown prince."
Sears endgame and Lampert's may diverge,"The Bank of Japan is sitting back for the ride. The central bank kept policy unchanged on Nov. 1, even as it trimmed inflation forecasts. Adding extra stimulus weeks after introducing a new, yield-focused framework would look nervous. The BOJ also needs something in reserve for potential upsets – like Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton in next week's U.S. presidential election."
U.S. Commerce Sec. Ross unaware of any planned warning for China travel,A U.S. Justice Department attorney on Thursday spelled out the circumstances under which Special Counsel Robert Mueller could be fired in a court case that took on new significance this week after President Donald Trump ousted his attorney general.
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen sentenced to three years prison,"China's president Xi Jinping has a flashy new title. The Communist Party has named him as its ""core"" leader - a moniker previously granted to icons like Mao and Deng but denied to his predecessor Hu Jintao. But Xi needs more than titles to implement tough reforms; he needs provincial allies and a viable vision for economic policy."
U.S. lawmaker hit backs at Pentagon argument for bigger budget,"In normal times, Mark Carney’s tenure as governor of the Bank of England would be of little interest beyond British policy circles. Though the central bank’s role has evolved over its 322-year history, its fate does not depend on a single leader. But these are not normal times - and that is why Britain will be better off if the Canadian extends his term."
Hadas: The stakeholder revolution has been delayed,"General Electric is taking its motto ""imagination at work"" to heart. The deal it has just cooked up with Baker Hughes, an oilfield-services rival, sets an intriguing precedent for the $267 billion industrial behemoth. The finances of the arrangement may stack up for shareholders, too. But what could set this transaction apart is GE's implicit recognition that the sum of its many parts may be more valuable than the whole."
Banks could do more in money laundering battle,"Britain has an enchanted airbag that will cushion the impact of leaving the European Union. How it works is a mystery. But Japanese carmaker Nissan, which just agreed to increase production in its Sunderland factory because of unspecified reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May, has had a glimpse. Not everyone affected by Brexit will be so lucky."
Big brokerage IPO requires faith in Chinese reform,"General Electric says it's not planning to acquire Baker Hughes, contrary to news reports. But shareholders shouldn't be shocked by the idea that the industrial conglomerate might take a look at the $23 billion oil-services firm. Since the panic of 2008 sparked an existential crisis at GE, the $258 billion GE has been on a massive diet plan. Today the company led by Jeff Immelt is fit for an offensive."
Iceland gives hedgies cooler welcome than Greece,"Can China avoid a financial crisis? That's the question facing regulators and investors after a rapid rise in leverage in the world's second-largest economy. The links between the official banking system and shadowy institutions have also grown deeper and harder for regulators to fathom. Breakingviews explains how the People's Republic might avert a meltdown, but might find a credit crunch harder to dodge."
Markets can ease Bank of England inflation dilemma,"Comcast is schooling AT&T on media M&A. The $155 billion cable giant now gets more than a third of its revenue from NBC Universal, a deal it concluded in early 2013. The regulatory and political climate was more accommodating and Chief Executive Brian Roberts' strategy sound. AT&T's $85 billion bid for Time Warner, by contrast, is a dog's breakfast."
Brexit could weaken Britain's puny productivity,Wells Fargo & Co  said on Monday it was expanding its operating committee and forming a business group to streamline its online services.
Spotless bid leaves private equity mess Down Under,"Wells Fargo is circling the stagecoaches around Chief Executive John Stumpf's top deputy. The $1.9 trillion lender just handed more power to President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan, with three new senior executives and an expanded financial-technology group reporting to him. That ostensibly puts Sloan in even better position to succeed his boss. It's not clear, however, why a man so closely linked to the fake-accounts scandal should be CEO."
